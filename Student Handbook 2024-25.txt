In creating the Emblem or Arms, the University sought to reflect its values and focus while maintaining a link with the College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST). The components, which are generally stylised, are interpreted below: 
The Doctor Bird (feeding on the hibiscus � a source of sustenance) and pineapples (part of the Jamaica Coat of Arms) symbolize the uniqueness of the institution as the foremost national university. The Lignum vitae, a native Jamaican flower, is abundant on the Liguanea Plains on which the University is located and symbolizes productivity and the capacity to withstand adversity. 
The sun symbolizes life, light and energy; the mountains � strength, majesty and beauty; the open book on its sides, which follows the contours of the mountains, the generation, accessibility and transfer of knowledge; and the pair of dividers, also a component of the CAST logo � technology and the continuity between CAST and UTech, 
Ja. 
The use of the Emblem is guided by the provisions of the Use of Emblem and Graphic Standards Policy which include the following:    
� The emblem should be used only on official university documents. These include letterheads, faculty brochures and other university stationery. 
� The emblem should be placed at the top left-hand corner of documents or top centre of degree parchments and certificates issued by the University alone, or the University in collaboration with other academic institutions. 
� No writing should appear above the emblem or to the left of it.
� The original colours (the University colours) should be represented exactly. 
� The emblem should not be encircled by lines or decorations. 
Permission to use the emblem must be sought from the Governance Committee through the Registrar. The process which normally takes two weeks is managed by the University Secretariat. Forms are available on the Intranet.
The University�s motto, �Magna per artem gesta� is engraved on the emblem. This Latin phase translates to �Excellence through Knowledge�. The University�s motto, �Magna per artem gesta� is engraved on the emblem. This Latin phase translates to �Excellence through Knowledge�.

The University of Technology, Jamaica (UTech, Ja.) dates its beginning from 1958, originally as the Jamaica Institute of Technology.  In 1959 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Arts, Science and Technology and  became incorporated in the College of Arts,  Science and Technology (CAST) Scheme of 1959. This was validated by an ACT of Parliament in 1964.  In 1986, the CAST Scheme was revised in order to make the College a degreegranting institution, and the College became legally empowered to conduct affairs under a governing Council and Academic Board. 
The institution was formally accorded University status on September 1, 1995 as the University of Technology, Jamaica. The University of Technology, Jamaica Act 27-1999, which makes permanent provisions for the establishment of the University of Technology, Jamaica was approved by Parliament on June 8, 1999 and signed into law by the Governor General on June 19, 1999. 
I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E U N I V E R S I T Y	
The history of the institution is intimately connected with the social and economic development of Jamaica.  From just over 50 students and four programmes in 1958, UTech, Jamaica has grown to become Jamaica�s premier national institution with a student population of over 13,000.  The University  now offers 100 programmes at the certificate, diploma and degree levels through its three colleges and five faculties. The University has further expanded access to its programme offerings to meet the demands of business and industry by establishing campuses and satellite locations across  Jamaica. In addition, several programmes are franchised through links with community  colleges, and most programmes are linked to national and international professional  organisations.   
Syllabuses are modeled on the English polytechnic system, with emphasis on flexibility of approach, work-based, experiential learning and professional linkages afforded through  co-operative work based programmes. Flexibility in the University�s academic programmes is reflected in the various modes of course delivery, which include the establishment of a semesterised mode of delivery introduced in academic year 1999/2000 and further adjusted and piloted in 2009�2010.   
I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E U N I V E R S I T Y
The University�s mandate is reflected in its  mission �� to positively impact Jamaica and the wider Caribbean through high quality learning opportunities, research and value-added  solutions to government, industry and communities�.  As such, the University�s three core pillars are teaching, research and service. 
� T H E P E O P L E � S U N I V E R S I T Y � 
The University prides itself on fulfilling its objective as �The People�s University�, dedicated to facilitating access to opportunities for learning and to meeting the growth and development needs of Jamaica. In addition to academic pursuits, our students have a rich and unique opportunity to participate in community service, sports, arts and culture which are deliberately blended into the curriculum to produce well-rounded graduates who benefit from a holistic UTech, Ja. learning experience. 
The institution�s academic progress, its burgeoning research and service initiatives,  growing prowess in sports interwoven with the integration of arts and culture, signal a continued bright future for the University of Technology, Jamaica as the Caribbean region�s vanguard of higher learning and excellence.

1. The Charter  � also called the First Schedule
2. The Statutes � also called the Second Schedule
The Act outlines the objects and functions of the University, ministerial policy directions, general provisions for staff, financial provisions, accounts and reports. The institution operates under a bicameral system of governance  comprising a governing body, the University Council, and the supreme academic arm, the Academic Board. Each body is supported by standing committees through which much of its work is expedited.  
The University is headed by the Chancellor  who presides over the convocation and is  supported by a Pro-Chancellor who is second in command.  
The President of the University is the chief academic and administrative officer of the University and presides over the meetings of the Academic Board. The President is supported by a Deputy President, Vice Presidents and other senior officers.  
	T 	 T
The Council is the ultimate authority on matters of governance. However, the nature of the bicameral system requires much consultation between Council and the Academic Board.  
The documents of university governance are: 
1. The University of Technology, Jamaica Act, No 27 of 1999, which contains the Charter and the Statutes
2. Ordinances � Rules made by the Council
3. Regulations � Rules as defined by the Academic Board
4. Policies � Administrative and Academic guidelines and procedures
5. Decisions of Council and Academic Board.
The University as a public body is also subject to other legislations such as: 
1. The Contractor General�s Act
2. Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act
3. Government Procurement Rules.

Orientation, or as we call it here at the University of Technology, Jamaica the �Week Of Welcome� (W.O.W) is what you get, a �WOW� experience! Usually, the 3rd week of August is busy with the orientation activities. It is intentional that each experience welcomes, informs, entertains,  inspires and propels the new student into  readiness for their academic success.   
All new and transfer students are required to participate in the week-long Orientation Programme, which contributes to the First Year Experience Programme. Being new in a large institution such as the University of Technology, Jamaica, can be very daunting. The orientation programme captures a vibrant campus atmosphere that make adjustments easier and allows all new students to confidently face the challenges and opportunities of University life.

All of this is crucial and beneficial to every student attending the University and presents necessary guidelines for a smooth transition. The Induction Ceremony, with its pomp and pageantry is the culminating event of the week.  New students are inducted into the University 
at this formal ceremony, chaired by a senior member of the University, attended by the University Chancellor, Officers of the University, the Students� Union President and the Academic and Administrative staff.

As we go through life, we are faced with many personal decisions and challenging problems.  These can be difficult and sometimes overwhelming to handle.  Many problems are solved through discussions with colleagues, friends, family, a lecturer, tutor, nurse, chaplain or counsellor. In some instances, it is best to obtain assistance away from one�s familiar daily environment.   
The University�s Counselling Unit is available to assist in addressing the needs of individuals who find it too challenging to adequately cope with life�s situations.  Getting professional help is about seeking viable options towards positive change and empowerment in one�s life.  Although there is no quick fix to every situation, talking confidentially with a trained professional is a major step towards resolving an issue. 

T H E C O U N S E L L I N G T E A M 
The Unit is staffed by a psychiatrist (part-time), a team of trained psychologists (psychotherapists), and chaplains.  They are all competently trained in helping clients from varying backgrounds and cultures, with a wide range of  personal and other issues. 
As counselling is a process that seeks to assist clients to focus on, and understand more clearly the issues that are affecting them, the counsellor�s role is to provide support and understanding, while listening and giving a non-judgmental response.  Our counsellors respect your values, choices and lifestyle, and want you to experience the best quality life while at the University of Technology, Jamaica. 
D U R A T I O N O F S E S S I O N S 
Typically, each counselling session lasts for fifty (50) minutes. However, shorter or longer sessions are sometimes held � depending on the circumstances.  While some matters might need only one session, others could necessitate months of regular visits.  Additional sessions can be arranged at the counsellors� discretion.
All information given at the counselling session is held in the strictest confidence, unless the client gives instructions otherwise. 
Confidential sessions are held on the following issues: 
� Abuse
� Addiction
� Adjustment
� Alcohol
� Anger
� Anxiety and Panic Attacks
� Assertiveness

The University has an International Students� Office (ISO) which is specifically equipped to support our international students by facilitating their recruitment, registration, accommodation and sponsorship. 
To facilitate their adjustment to the new environment, the ISO organizes a number of functions for international students.  A City Tour is organized in August to familiarize students with places they need to know in Kingston and St. Andrew and the immediate environs of the UTech, Ja. campus.  In September, the ISO hosts a reception to formally welcome students to the UTech, Ja. family and in April the Registrar hosts a dinner for all final-year international students. 
Additionally, the ISO assists students with student-related services, including passport and immigration related issues, guidance and refer-ences for opening bank accounts and basic security and safety guidelines.  
Throughout the year, the University of 
Technol-ogy, Jamaica, International Students� Association (UTISA), supported by the ISO, hosts other activities that showcase the students� unique cultures and talents, and plans excursions, and other non-academic activities. 
Finally and importantly, the ISO assists with the recruitment of international students and pro-motes the University overseas. 
The Office is located at the Student Services 
Building and is managed by the International Students� Coordinator, Mrs. Janice Sinclair- Morgan.  She can be contacted by e-mail:

Contact with the International Students� Office: The most important contact for international students is the International Students� Office (ISO). The ISO is located on the first floor of the Student Services Building, beside the Medical Centre.  The ISO will assist you with all the necessary information for the first few days in Jamaica.  It is important that the ISO is kept abreast of your contact numbers as well as your place of residence in case of an emergency. 
Transportation to the UTech Campus: The University provides transportation from the Norman Manley International Airport to the UTech, Ja. campus, providing that you communicate your travel itinerary to the ISO at least two (2) weeks before arrival.  Alternatively, we recommend that you take JUTA taxis only from the airport to the campus.  The cost from the Norman Manley International Airport to the UTech, Ja.  campus or its immediate environs is approximately US$60.00.  This may be less if students travel in groups. 
Sponsored Students: Sponsored students must submit a Letter of Commitment from their sponsor to the ISO to show proof of sponsorship. You will not be able to register as a sponsored student unless the International Students� Coordinator has cleared you.

Sciences � was launched on Monday, December 10, 2012. The centre is located to the northern end of UTech, Jamaica Papine campus, adjacent to the Cynthia Shako Early Childhood Education & Daycare Centre.

In 2012 she was appointed the first University Ambassador of the University of Technology, Jamaica in recognition of her demonstrated significant interest and pride in the University and as well as her high standards of integrity.  In November 2016, she was conferred with the degree of Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa.   
The services currently offered by SAFACC include: 
� Screening, assessment and intervention of

1. Based on the modules selected and the creditassignment for each module, an invoice is generated automatically; which details the total amount for which the student is billed for the modules selected; plus the miscellaneous fees.
2. The flexibility of semesterization allowsstudents to take a minimum of nine (9) credits per semester; thereby giving them the freedom to meet their financial obligations to the University.
3. Irrespective of the number of modulesselected, students are required to pay in full (100%) for all modules selected, as well as clear any outstanding balance previously owed to the University.
4. The number of modules selected can be aslow as 9 credits or as high as 21 credits; and the number of modules selected should be based on the student's ability to pay.
5. This means that the 100% fee paymentrequirement will vary from student to stu- dent; depending on the number of mod- ules that are selected.
6. The University may decide to offer a pay- ment plan to students.
7. If offered, all students who do not pay 100% offees for modules selected by the Census Date, would default to the University�s Standard Payment Plan for that semester and would be subjected to all terms and conditions of the plan.

The University will notify students of the Reg- istration Census Date for each semester. The Census Date is the final date for students to be registered on-time, in order to avoid late fee penalties. 
The Census Date is also important; because it is the final date for students to indicate to the University their intentions to enroll for a given semester. This will allow the University to effectively plan for the delivery of classes in that semester.

I M P L I C A T I O N S O F T H E R E G I S T R A T I O N
C E N S U S D A T E
Any confirmed modules which remain on the system after the Census Date, would be considered an indication from the student that: 
� he/she intends to be in school for that semester;
� the modules confirmed are the ones the student will undertake;
� the modules confirmed are the ones for which the student should be held liable.
Essentially by confirming the modules as at the Census Date, a student has given the University the go-ahead to provide the required resources for teaching and learning for that semester. This means the student accepts full liability for the fees generated as of module selection and  conformation.

The Students� Union Council members receive an incentive at the end of each academic year; which is paid as a percentage of tuition fees for that year. This incentive is referred to as the  Performance -Based Reward (PBR). 
The PBR is paid after a performance evaluation process which would determine if the Council member is eligible for the PBR based on the result of the performance review. 
The PBR is paid by cheque to the individual Council Member and is therefore processed as follows: 
1. A written request for payment is sent by the Assistant Registrar, Student Services to the Snr. Director, Business and Asset Administration for approval.
2. Following receipt of approval from the Snr. Director, the documents are then sent to the Snr. Accountant, Payroll/Payables for the cheque to be generated.

Employment is provided for students on campus through the Earn and Study Programme. Student workers are recruited and assigned to various Departments, Faculties and Colleges across the University and work is scheduled to avoid conflict with the students� academic performance. Students employed on the programme gain valuable work experience as an important complement to their academic pursuits. They also have the opportunity to earn additional income to assist with school related expenses. Earn and Study operates through two programmes: (i) the Regular Programme and (ii) the Expanded Programme. Together, these two student work programmes allow for greater accessibility and reach to a wider cross-section of students who are in need of campus employment. 
E L I G I B I L I T Y C R I T E R I A F O R T H E R E G U L A R E A R N & S T U D Y P R O G R A M M E 
1. All enrolled unemployed students within a given academic year are eligible to partici-
pate in the Earn & Study Programme. However, in order to ensure greater accessibility, students are only allowed to work in one of the two employment batches each year.  
2. Students interested in participating in the Earn and Study Programme may choose one of the following options:
� Option 1 � Working in semesters 1 and 2, where students are allowed to work 25hrs per work / 50 hours per fortnight. Payment is made on a fortnightly basis.
� Option 2 � Working in the summer session, where students are allowed to work a 40-hour work. Payment is made on a monthly basis.
3. Within any given academic year, students who work in the semesters are not allowed to work in the Summer Session; and vice versa.
4. First year students are NOT allowed to work in semesters 1 and 2, of their first year but may work in the summer session of that first year.
5. Final year students are NOT allowed to work in semesters 1 and 2 of their last year; but may work in the summer session of that final year.
6. Students on Academic Probation (GPA of
2.0 or below) will not be employed on the Regular Earn & Study Programme as they  2 0 2 4
will need to focus on improving their academic performance in order to maintain their studentship.  
7. For the Regular Programme, students do not get to select where they are placed but all efforts will be made to ensure that there is a best fit for placements taking into account the students� experience, skills and the Department�s needs.
8. However, a student is not disadvantaged due to lack of experience or qualification as the aim of the Regular Programme is to expose students to the world of work and to provide that desired experience which will assist them once they have completed their studies.
9. The application period for the Regular Earn & Study Programme are as follows:
� Semesters I and II � August of each year
� Summer Session � April of each year
E L I G I B I L I T Y C R I T E R I A F O R T H E E X P A N D E D E A R N & S T U D Y P R O G R A M M E 
1. All enrolled unemployed students are eligible to participate in the Earn & Study Programme. 
2. However, placement on the expanded programme is dependent on a student�s availability since this programme usually requires students to work well beyond the 25 hours a week required for the Regular Programme.
3. Often  the required work hours are between 8:00 and 4:00 and so an ideal candidate for the Expanded Programme should not be carP�8Prying the full credit load; but should instead be enrolled on modules which equate to part-time studies. 
4. For the Expanded Programme, students do not get to select where they are placed. Placements are done based on the specific needs of the Department in an attempt to achieve the right job fit with the skills and experience that the receiving Department needs.
5. Students at all programme levels are able to work and there are no restrictions on the employment period for a student within each academic year. This means that students are allowed to work unbroken throughout the academic year.
6. However, students on Academic Probation (GPA of 1.70 or below) will not be employed on the Expanded Earn & Study Programme as they will need to focus on improving their academic performance in order to maintain their studentship. 
7. There is no specific application period for the Expanded Programme as placement is done in response to the needs of the Departments which can be at any time throughout the year. Once a need is established, suitable candidates will be identified from the Earn & Study Skills Bank which is a reservoir of data from the Earn & Study applications.

Ques. 31: If I need an official estimate of my tuition fee to take to a financial institution for assistance, what can I do? 
Ans:	The student can request a letter/statement from the Student Financial Services Unit in the Finance Division indicating an estimate of fees. This will take a minimum of seven (7) working days. 
S T A T E M E N T O F F E E S 
Ques 32: Can I get an official statement of my account balance? 
Ans:	Yes. Students can obtain a statement from the Student Financial Services Unit in the Finance Division. This process may take a minimum  of seven (7) working days.

R E G I S T R A T I O N 
Ques. 33 After I have received my fee breakdown and made the necessary payments, am I registered? 
Ans.: 	No. Students are not registered until they have completed the 10-step  process online.

Ans.: 	No. Students are not entitled to a reduction in their fees if they have received exemptions. 
Ques. 37: Why do we pay an Enrolment  Commitment Fee (ECF)? 
Ans.: 	Payment of the ECF is an indication of the student�s commitment to pursue studies for a given semester and therefore allows the student to begin the enrolment (module selection) process. In the first semester (only) of each academic year, the ECF represents a contribution towards the ancillary charges of your school fee. It is mandatory and non-refundable.  
In two subsequent semesters it is a initial deposit on total tuition fees.

As an academic community, the University seeks to establish and maintain an environ-
ment conducive to effective teaching, learning and research. This requires the co-operation of all members of the community to ensure academic and intellectual freedom and maintain the highest standards in teaching, learning, research, evaluation and personal integrity. 
In addition to being bound by the policies, laws and regulations of the University, registered students are also bound by the specific regulations of the programme in which they are enrolled. They are expected, therefore, to  familiarize themselves with these regulations. 
The University is a public institution that provides educational opportunities to a large student body and serves a wide variety of interest groups. Thus, it is important for the institution to have a set of rules to govern the interaction of students, faculty and the wider University community. Acceptable standards of student conduct are based on common sense and  common courtesy.  
S T U D E N T R E S P O N S I B I L I T I E S	
Students who breach the University or Faculty Regulations by failing to conduct themselves in an acceptable manner by violating the rights of others, by damaging University property, or by being found guilty of breaching the Regulations in another way may be asked to discontinue their studies. 
C L A S S AT T E N D A N C E 
Consistent class attendance will ensure you the best opportunity for optimum academic performance. Absence from laboratory/practical classes and/or courses where class work contributes to the final grade will have a negative impact on your student achievement. College/ Faculty-specific requirements exist for some programmes.

them immediately to their College/Faculty/ School Examination Coordinator for resolution. 
The draft timetable is subject to change and should not be used to make pre-arranged plans concerning the final examination dates.  
Students are encouraged to constantly review the draft examination timetable, both on eVision and the University Examinations Notice Board, until the final timetable is published.

The University recognizes that despite all measures and procedures defined by the administration, oftentimes students, without applying efforts towards their personal care and responsibility, may expose themselves to some  levels of security vulnerabilities.  In such contexts, students are urged to be aware of measures that can be taken  personally to prevent falling a victim to criminal actions. Some guideline and tips are: 
T 	 T	 2 0 2 4
� Be cautious against exploitation of fraudulent acts , particularly when conducting financial transactions. Use the legitimate channels and institutions  recommended by the University when paying fees, and be absolutely sure you are familiar with options taken.  Otherwise , if in any doubt seek  advice from the Offices of the Student Services or Student Financing and  keep note of any specific officer on whose advice you acted on. To engage otherwise it may be interpreted that you are complicit with the activity and be subjected  to police investigations.  
� Never leave valuable items unattended or exposed in a motor vehicle, especially on seats. Such act attracts thieves. 
� Always double check to ensure car doors and windows are secured.
� Be selective of places chosen to lodge, find out the characteristics of the community and determine how to navigate around. 
� Use legitimate transport services if not those provided by the University. Get information from the Student Union Council on recommend options for safe  transportation. 
� Plan your daily routines and avoid having 
to travel with unnecessary resources or  valuables. 
� Keep family and trusting friends aware of your whereabouts when off campuses. 
� Make use of Social Media resources if you suspect your safety is about to be compromised when off campuses. 
� At social events , avoid becoming intoxicated and losing self control. It becomes far too easy to be taken advantage of when you cant think or act rationally. 
� If involved in an accident, think clearly, be calm and evaluate the possibilities before alighting from motor vehicle. 
� When driving, respect the lives of others, be courteous to other road users and avoid speeding or reckless maneuvers. 
In light of all the forgoing guidelines and advice, students are reminded that Safety and Security becomes everyone�s responsibility. The University remains committed to satisfy all its obligations in such regards and urge adherence to all safety and security measures so that everyone may enjoy the benefits of an incident free environment.

The Students� Union provides an opportunity for the growth and development of the students we serve and also for those in our immediate/surrounding communities. This is done through organizing sustainable activities that will be impactful and beneficial for the betterment and development of participants. In an attempt to fulfil this desire to contribute, the Union plans and executes two major signature projects each year.  
1 . T H E � T E A C H T H E Y O U T H � P R O G R A M M E 
This programme was developed in the summer of 1999 to carry out remedial and other educational work, directly benefiting two communities. The programme has since been expanded to five communities: Kintyre, August Town, Tavern, Highlight View and Sandy Park, and it is now mandated as an annual event. Despite being on a two year hiatus as a result of the pandemic the council is pushing to see the reintroduction of the flagship initiative in this academic year.   
2 . � N A T I O N W I D E T A G D R I V E � 
Students traverse the country in an attempt to solicit funds to aid various charitable organizations and or needy individuals. The �Tag Drive� consists of a week of activities in semester one each year. These include a church service, a �Celebrity Dutch Auction�, a collection in the Kingston Corporate Area and, on the final day, an island-wide collection. The Tag Drive is geared towards empowering students to gain levels of self-fulfilment from knowing that they are participating in an event that benefits the less fortunate in our society.  
CLUBS AND SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS 
There are several student-based associations at the University of Technology, Jamaica. These recognized clubs/societies fall under the auspices of the Students� Union Council. Through recent amendments, the First Vice President, Clubs and Societies in association with the Director of Elections governs all proceedings of clubs and societies ranging from students� activity clubs and professional societies to cultural, religious and special interest groups.

They all offer students an opportunity for increased social interaction and the ability to gain invaluable experience while expanding their network of friends and associates. All students are encouraged to join at least one student-based organization in order to increase their social activism.

Withdrawal from a module is intended to assist students who are insufficiently prepared to complete and be examined in the module.  
A student wishing to withdraw from a module shall discuss the matter with his/her Academic Advisor [Programme Director in the case of graduate students], complete the withdrawal form, and submit the completed form to the Programme Director (copied to the Head of School/Department) for approval no less than two weeks before the official suspension of classes for the Semester or the Summer Session.  The student will be informed of the decision by the Programme Director (copied to Records Office). Where withdrawal is granted, a �WM� will be placed on the student�s record, but it will not affect the calculation of the GPA.  
No withdrawal is permissible within the last two weeks before the official suspension of classes, and any non-attendance thereon will be subjected to the Examinations Policy. �Drop-out� of class is not withdrawal, and such action may result in a �Fail� grade for the module. 
The approval of the request for withdrawal cannot be revoked, and there will be no right to appeal. Students are limited to a maximum of two module withdrawals in any semester or summer session. Students are advised to redo the module(s) at the next available offering. 
There is no refund of module fee when a  student withdraws from a module.

4.2. To receive a university award, a student must successfully complete the requirements of his/her course of study as well as fulfil other obligations to the University. To be eligible for graduation, a student must be in good academic standing and have satisfied all other obligations to the University. 
Generally, a student will be eligible to receive a degree, diploma, associate degree, certificate or other award when: 
a) He/she has successfully completed (passed) all modules and assigned credit hours in a prescribed course of study. 
b) He/she has been recommended by both the College/Faculty Board of Examiners and the Registrar. 
c) He/she has met the requirements specified in Ordinance 7, and 
d) The recommendation has been approved by the Academic Board.
4.3. The University also offers a variety of profes-sional courses, and the requirements of professional bodies and of the University must be satisfied before an award may be granted. 
4.4. (a)    Course of Study 
This is a plan of study lasting over a specified period of time which leads to the award of a Degree, Diploma, Certificate or other academic certification of the university. 
(b) Prescribed (Normal) Timeframe
This is the stated duration of a course of study. Note: Where the loading is below the average required per semester, students need to take additional modules in subsequent academic session (s) to make up. 
(c) Maximum Timeframe
The rationale for placing a timeframe on completing a course of study is to ensure that the award reflects currency of knowledge and skill. The maximum timeframe to complete a course of study for the following award is:
� Bachelor�s Degree � prescribed time frame plus 3 years 
� Diploma � 5 years
� Associate Degree � 4 years
� Certificate � 3 years The maximum timeframe does not include approved Leave of Absence or extenuating circumstances, such as illness. (d) Discretionary Extension of Studentship for completion of Award Students who have expired the prescribed and maximum permissible timeframe and who require an extension to satisfy the completion of their awards, may apply to the respective College or Faculty Board for an extension of no more than two years. The  College/Faculty will act under the delegated authority of the Academic Board and will report its decision for noting to the next scheduled meeting of the Academic Board. [This provision is also applicable to graduate students] 
e) Appeals - Discretionary Extension of 
Studentship for completion of Award Students who have been denied the discretionary extension (maximum 2 years) by their respective College/ Faculty Board, may appeal the decision to the Academic Board Student Academic Affairs� Review Panel (ABSAARP). 
Having reviewed the decision of the College/ Faculty Board, the ABSAARP may confirm, reverse or vary the recommendation of the College/Faculty Board. The decision of the Panel shall be final. [This provision is also applicable to graduate students] 
f) Accelerated Completion of
Degree/Diploma/Certificate
This is the completion of a Course of Study in a shorter prescribed timeframe based on a students� decision to increase his/her credit load in a given academic year, as approved by the Head of School/Department.

5.1. The specific method of evaluation for modules will be established by each academic unit within the framework approved by the Office of Teaching and Learning. A student�s 

	 	T E C H N O L O G Y	 2 0	2 0 2 5
final academic standing will be determined by his/her achievement throughout the academic year or module delivery period, taking into account evaluation measures such as classroom or proctored tests and examinations, laboratory work, projects, supervised practical experiences, theses and their defence.  Academic staff shall advise students of the method of evaluation of each module, no later than the beginning of the module delivery. [This applies to graduate students as well]

An incomplete (L) grade is given when the coursework requirement is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances.  In this case a DF for deferred result will show on the student portal. In such circumstances students are afforded an opportunity by the lecturer to complete and submit the outstanding work no later than the validation exercise period.  If the coursework has not been submitted the incomplete grade will be converted to a �Fail� grade during the validation exercise, unless permitted by the College/Faculty Board of Examiners for an additional period of time not exceeding one semester.  In such case, the change is made by completing the Change of Grade form.  An �L� will not affect the GPA. 
An absent (AB) is assigned to students who have either withdrawn from a module without permission, missed the coursework test or the final examination. Where students have failed to submit part of their assessment components without permission, such as term paper or  project, an �NS� is given. 
Percentages are used to facilitate staff in marking individual assignments and examination but are not used to express the final result. 
5 . 3	G R A D I N G P O L I C Y 
5.3.1	The final result for each module is expressed as a grade and grade point. 
5.3.2	A student�s overall academic performance at the end of the academic year will be determined by weighting each module grade point earned in accordance with its credit allocation and expressed as a Grade Point Average (GPA). 
5.3.3	Except for special requirements, usually of an external nature, the final grade for a module is determined by weighting the allocation of marks for coursework assignments and final examination. The allocation to coursework may vary from 40 to 100  per cent. 
5.3.4	In a module that is examined by coursework and final examination, students may be given both their grade and percentage mark for coursework assignments. For modules examined by coursework only, the student will be given only the grade for their coursework assessments. 
5.3.5	An undergraduate module will have been 
passed if the final result is grade C or above. However, some modules will have a higher passing grade to meet professional requirements. 
5.3.6	If a student has failed a module, he/she must redo the module and the assessment components, including coursework and final examination. The final grade for the module will be the weighted average of new coursework and the new final exam mark.

Level 3 and 4 students may enrol in three modules beyond the requirement of the Course of Study.  This is to encourage students to enrich their learning by exploring other modules offered by the University. These additional modules, may be credited normally or under the Pass/Fail system. 
When credited normally, the grade will affect the GPA. Under the Pass/Fail system, a student will be given a �P� when a grade of �C-�or better is obtained or an �F� for a failing grade, but neither the �P� nor the �F� will affect the GPA. 
Students wishing to enrol in a module as 
Pass/Fail should complete the Pass/Fail form 
(available at the Student Affairs Office) and  submit it to the Programme Director within six weeks or five weeks of the start of the semester or summer session, respectively.  Otherwise, the module will be treated normally and the final result will affect the GPA.

1. The final result for each module is expressed as a grade and grade point. A graduate module will have been passed if the final result is grade B or above.
2. A student�s overall academic performance will be determined by weighting each module grade point earned in accordance with its credit allocation and expressed as a Grade Point Average (GPA). The calculation of graduate students� GPA is the same as set out in Table 4 above.
3. Except for special requirements, usually of an external nature, the final grade for a module is determined by weighting the allocation of marks for coursework assignments and final examination.
4. If a student has failed a module, he/she must redo the module and the assessment components, including coursework and final examination. The final grade for the module will be the weighted average of new coursework and the new final exam mark.
5. Students have a maximum of two opportu nities for the assessment of coursework work and sitting a final examination in a module.

4. Introduction
4.1. External examiners are essential to the academic well-being of the University.  Their involvement ensures that the institution�s awards are comparable in standards to awards granted and conferred by other institutions of higher education.  Their comments on assessment procedures, the standard, content and development of the course form a vital part of the process within the University for the monitoring of its courses. 
4.2. The External examiners also fulfil an essential role in ensuring that all assessments are in accordance with approved assessment regulations, justice is done to the individual student, and appropriate consideration is given to individual students� extenuating circumstances. 
5. Selection of External Examiners
5.1. The University�s Regulation (and the regulations of external bodies, where appropriate) require external examiners to be involved with all examinations and other forms of assessment which contribute to the students� final awards.  External examiners must therefore be 
involved in assessments of pre-final stages of courses if there is a carry  forward mark to the final award. 
5.2. External examiners are drawn from a wide variety of institutional/ professional contexts and traditions in order that individual courses of study have the benefit of wide ranging external scrutiny.  Normally, there must not be: 
5.2.1 reciprocal external examining between courses in two institutions; 
5.2.2 replacement of an external examiner by an individual from the same institution; 
5.2.3 an external examiner from an institution which has been the source of examiners in the recent past (normally four years).  
5.3. When making the nomination of an external examiner, the Head of School/Department (or equivalent), in consultation with other Heads of School/Department (if appropriate) will ensure that: 
5.3.1 Where there is a team of external examiners for a course of study, there is an adequate balance including: 
(a) examining experience,
(b) academic and professional practitioners, and
(c) members from different institutions of higher education
5.3.2 The nominee has achieved academic and professional qualifications in an appropriate subject, and at a level appropriate for the course of study to be examined. 
5.3.3 The nominee is of an appropriate academic and/or professional standing to maintain the comparability of academic standards in the context of higher  education. 
5.3.4 The nominee has sufficient recent experience of examining at the required level, preferably including experience as an external examiner or comparable related experience to indicate competence in assessing students in the subject area concerned. 
5.3.5 The nominee will not have such other extensive examining commitments that they cannot properly discharge their duties in respect of this University. 
5.3.6 The nominee will be impartial in judgement, and for the last five years the nominee normally must not have been: 
(a) a member of staff, a student or a near relative of a member of staff in relation to the Course of Studies, or who had a relationship with any of the above;
(b) an examiner from any other institution of higher education which jointly delivers a Course of Study with this University.
(c) be involved as an external examiner for the Course of Study when it was approved by another validating body; 
In addition, the nominee must not be: 
(d) personally associated with the sponsorship of students;
(e) required to assess colleagues who are recruited as students to the course of study;
(f) in a position to influence significantly the future employment of students on the Course of Study; 
(g) likely to be involved with student placements or training in the examiner�s organisation.
5.3.7 An external examiner must immediately notify the University Registrar in writing of any material change of circumstances which would lead to a breach of the  conditions of appointment outlined above. 
A P P O I N T M E N T O F E X T E R N A L E X A M I N E R S 
6. External examiners shall be appointed by the Academic Board after consideration of recommendations from the Faculty/College Board. The University Registrar will forward a letter of appointment to the external examiner with a copy to the relevant Dean, and Head of School/Department.
E C H N O L O G Y	 2 0 2 4
7. Appointments of external examiners shall be for a period of not more than
four years, in the first instance, but may be extended for a period of not more than two years for a new course of study in order to provide continuity between successive groups of external examiners. External examiners who have served for one appointment period in the same course of study should not be considered for re-nomination in the same course until at least four years have elapsed. 
8. Regulations for the award(s), Notes of Guidance, and information on fees and expenses will be forwarded at this stage to the external examiner by the University Registrar.  In order to ensure that the new external examiner is fully aware of all matters which have been raised previously, he/she will also be provided with the annual reports of her/his predecessor for the previous two years.
9. The Head of School/Department shall ensure that the external examiner:
9.1 receives a copy of a definitive document, together with any other information relating to the academic nature of the Course of Study to be considered; 
9.2 is adequately briefed on the procedures and timetable for the assessment of students for that particular Course of  Study.  The briefing must include (where appropriate): 
9.3 date of the Faculty/College Board of Examiners� meetings 
9.4 aims and objectives of the Course of Study 
9.5 syllabuses and teaching methods 
9.6 methods of assessment and marking 
9.7 regulations for the Course of Study 
9.8 is in agreement with how their responsibilities will be fulfilled, e.g. the sample of assessments that will be moderated and their involvement during the year. 
10. External examiners shall undertake validation duties on behalf of the university.  Validation is a process wherein external examiners scrutinize samples of students� assessed work and grades to ensure that appropriate quality and standards are maintained within the specifications of the relevant course of study.  The duties of external examiners shall include:
10.1 consultation with members of the School/Internal Examination Panel in relation to the approval and moderation of examination papers and other forms of assessment; 
10.2 consideration of the standard of marking of papers and other forms of assessment and reporting to members of the School/Internal Examination Panel on such revisions of the markings as they consider necessary; 

10.3 attendance with or without one or more members of the School/Internal Examination Panel at viva voce examinations and oral examinations which are held at the discretion of the external 
examiners; 
10.4 confirmation, by joint signature with Chairman of Faculty/College Board of Examiners, of the pass and classified lists of candidates including recommendation for the award of degree, diploma, certificate and other academic distinctions; 
10.5 submission to the President, as Chairman of the Academic Board, reports on the examinations and on any matter relating to the organisation, syllabus and structure of the Course of Study, with copies submitted to the Deputy President, Academic Affairs, and the Dean, as Chairman of the Faculty/College Board. Reports on examinations shall include: 
10.5.1 the overall performance of       students relative to peers in        similar courses of study 
10.5.2 the strengths and weaknesses        of students 
10.6 such other duties as the Academic Board may specify from time to time. 
11. The Faculty/College Board of Examiners may adjust the marks of any student, taking into consideration the advice of the School/Internal examination panel,
the external examiner and the overall performance of the student. Where there is disagreement within the Faculty/College Board of Examiners about results or classifications, the view of the external examiners shall prevail. 
12. Unresolved disagreement between 
external examiners shall be reported to the Academic Board.
13. External examiners shall be present at all meetings where the performance of candidates, (which contributes to the final award), is being considered.
14. In exceptional circumstances, the Deputy President, Academic Affairs, acting on the authority of the Academic Board, shall make arrangements for the external examinination of a course of study during the absence of the external examiners. This may include the submission of written reports or the appointment of substitute examiners or both.
15. The Academic Board may prescribe that the external examiners shall be present for consideration of all stages of the examining of a Course of Study.

16. Acting on the authority of the Academic Board, the Faculty/College Board shall appoint a School/Internal Examination Panel to verify the examination of a
course of study.  Verification is an internal quality process that determines whether the examination complies with specifications of the Course of Study. The Chairman of this Panel shall be the Head of the School or Department in which the Course of Study is located, or his or her nominee. 
17. Members of the Panel shall be the Head of School/Department, Programme Director(s), Programme Leader(s), the Examination Officer, and any other persons approved by the Faculty/College Board.
18. The duties of the School/Internal Examination Panel shall be as follows:
18.1 To ensure that the examination process has been carried out in accordance with University and Faculty/College  regulations; 
18.2 To review a candidate�s module results in examination and other forms of assessments that have been submitted to the School/Department; 
18.3 To determine provisional marks, academic status and/or University award for each candidate in a Course of Study and submit the same to the External Examiners and/or the Faculty/College 
Board of Examiners; 
18.4 To ensure that each candidate�s examination and other forms of assessment are available to the external 
examiners and/or the Faculty/College Board of Examiners; 
18.5 To ensure that any other pertinent information that has had a bearing on the provisional recommendations is made available to the External Examiners and/or the Faculty/College Board of Examiners.  
P U B L I C AT I O N O F R E S U LT S 
19. The list of results obtained by candidates in each examination, and the decisions about the academic progress of candidates, shall be drawn up by the Faculty/ College Board of Examiners. The Faculty/College Board of Examiners shall forward:
19.1 to the Academic Board the pass and  classified lists of candidates who have successfully completed the final examinations leading to a degree, diploma, certificate or other academic distinction of the University; 
19.2 to the appropriate institution or professional body results of candidates in examinations leading to an award of the body concerned.  
20. Faculty/College Board of Examiners shall publish pass lists of candidates who have successfully completed the final examinations leading to a degree, diploma, certificate or other academic distinction of the University, and an aca-
demic progress list of other candidates, who are not at a stage in their course of study leading to a degree, diploma,  certificate or other academic distinction of the University. 
21. All candidates shall be provided with a written record of the decision, which the Faculty/College Board of Examiners has taken about their progress.
22. When a module that contributes to a final award has been examined after a semester, or any other period of the academic year, but before the external examiner(s) can be present on the Faculty/College Board of Examiners, then the School/Internal Examination Panel may publish the provisional results, on the condition that the notice clearly states that the results are provisional and are awaiting submission to the Faculty/College Board of Examiners for validation.

23. Except where alternative arrangements have been approved by or on behalf of the Academic Board, all written examinations and other forms of assessment that were examined during a candidate�s course of study shall be retained for three years following the date on which the results were published.
24. Candidates shall not have access to examination scripts.
Work on which cumulative and other forms of assessment have been used may be returned to the candidates on a written undertaking that it shall be given back, if required, at any time. Failure on the part of a candidate to return work as required will be sufficient reason for a Faculty/College Board of Examiners not to take the work into account in determining the results of the candidate. 
Students who do not submit module project requirements in accordance with the required deadlines will be deemed to have failed that part of the course.

25. Students have the right to appeal the final grade assigned to a module.
25.1 A student who is dissatisfied with his/her examination result may submit a written request to the Academic Board, through the Head of School/Department in which the module was taught, within two weeks after the publication of thefinal grade.  The request for review must be accompanied by any evidence which the student believes can justify a review. 
 	T E C H N O L O G Y	 2 0 2 4 �
25.2 The request for review must be accompanied by a receipt as evidence that the student has paid the examination review 
fee in accordance with current University rates.  The fee will only be refunded if the grade is raised.  The review process can take up to four weeks, and the student will be informed in writing of the result.

The following conditions and procedures apply to: 
1.1 Academic misconduct and irregularities in all university module assessment, as well as other forms of academic malfeasance. These specifically relate to: 
1.1.1 University final theory, oral, or practical examinations; 
1.1.2 College/Faculty examinations, which include all tests, assignments, oral and practical examinations related to course work and projects at the school academic unit level; 
R E G U L AT I O N 5 ( S TAT U T E X I I I )	
1.2 Other forms of academic misconduct. 
2 . 0	A C A D E M I C M I S C O N D U C T 
Generally, academic misconduct consists of academic dishonesty, fraud or unethical behaviour, i.e. those acts which have the effect of unfairly promoting or enhancing one�s academic standing or assisting someone in the pursuit of such a result. Acts of academic dishonesty are serious matters, which subvert the integrity and credibility of the educational process. The University will, therefore, initiate action to sanction students who have engaged in acts of academic dishonesty, fraud or unethical behaviour/conduct. 
3 . 0 	C AT E G O R I E S O F A C A D E M I C M I S C O N D U C T 
The assigning and evaluating of academic exercises in the form of essays, projects, laboratory reports, presentations, tests and examinations are central to the assessment process, both as guidance to the student and as a means of maintaining appropriate standards of quality assurance for  T

accreditation purposes. It is required that all academic assignments submitted for evaluation and course credit be the product of the student�s individual effort, except in the case of team projects arranged and approved of by the instructor. 
Examination misconduct constitutes an attempt on the part of the student/candidate to undermine the University�s examination exercise, that is, any act carried out during an examination for the  purpose of obtaining credit dishonestly.  
Under this policy, there are three categories of academic misconduct � gross, major and lesser offences. 
	3.1	Gross Offences 
3.1.1 	Offences committed during an assessment (course work and/or examination) 
a. Presenting oneself for another candidate for the purpose of taking a test or examination; or by allowing oneself to be represented by another for the same;
b. Surreptitiously obtaining prior knowledge of the content of an examination question paper and using same in the examination.. 
c. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as gross offences by the University.
	3.1.2 	Offences Committed Outside an Assessment (Coursework or Examination) 
a. Contributing to the breach or leakage of content of an examination question paper.
b. Selling, publishing unadministered examination papers or other work assigned for purposes of academic credit;
c.Altering assessment work after it has been evaluated; 
d. Forging, altering or falsifying any academic record, or making use of any such altered, forged, or falsified record for purposes of obtaining academic credit;
e. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as gross offences by the University.
Gross offences committed outside of an examination shall be subject to the same disciplinary procedures as if committed in an examination room. 
	3.2	Major Offences 
	3.2.1	Offences Committed during  an assessment (course work or examination) 
  These include: 
a. Copying from another candidate�s paper;
b. Using unauthorized examination aids (i.e. any material that could potentially aid the student in an examination for the module being assessed);
c. Using unauthorized electronic, communication and storage devices; using any device that is capable of accessing the internet, or linked to any other device or has storage capabilities
d. Knowingly allowing one�s work to be copied during an assessment;
e. Collaborating with another candidate orally, in writing or by signal during an assessment without permission;
f. Directly or indirectly giving assistance to another candidate during an assessmentwithout permission;
g. Accepting unauthorized assistance whether directly or indirectly from another individual in the sitting of an examination;
h. Failure to submit examination script or other pertinent examination material as required. (Note that a zero will be given for the material not submitted.)
i. Leaving an examination room with items demanded to be presented or submittedby an assessor/invigilator/examiner�
j. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as major offences by the University. 
3.2.2 	Offences Committed Outside an Examination These include: 
a. Fabricating research results, including false claims regarding research results, interviews or procedures; the omission of statements regarding interviews, procedures, or experiments, where the omission cannot be justified; 
b. Plagiarism: presenting any material, whether in written, oral or electronic form, that is attributable to, or the property of another person as one�s own work without acknowledging the source from which the material is taken. Merely changing the words in someone else�s work still constitutes plagiarism. This includes in whole or in part, but is not limited to the following materials: articles, essays, journals, diagrams, graphs, tables, computer software, GIS files, photographs, digital images, designs, models, maps, theses, dissertations, reports, projects, lectures, music or other works of art; 
c. (Some ways of avoiding plagiarism include using direct quotations, paraphrasing with acknowledgement of the source for example URL addresses, author, year, publisher and page where possible;).  This includes aiding and abetting plagiarism.
d. Representing as one�s individual writing and/or final product a jointly written or produced submission of any description, unless the instructor has approved a co-authored submission;
e. Submitting work for which credit has been previously obtained or is being sought in another course or programme of study in the University or elsewhere, without authorization from the College/Faculty concerned;
f. Copying another person�s paper, lab report or other assignment;
g. Conducting research in an unethical manner;
h. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as major offences by the University.

The policy presents the division of the specialisation credits to enable �major and �minor�  specialisation descriptors in a course of study. 
Although the courses of study in the University frequently exceed the 120�130 credit hour range prescribed (because of professional requirements or international comparability) the percentage allocated to categories of modules in a course of study remains constant. M A J O R S P E C I A L I Z A T I O N I N A 
C O U R S E O F S T U D Y
A major specialization is the primary focus of a course of study. It is a cohesive combination of modules, including introductory, intermediate, and advanced modules that designate a  student�s primary area of specialization. Single subject major: 46%� 52% credit hours D O U B L E M A J O R S P E C I A L I Z A T I O N I N A 
C O U R S E O F S T U D Y
A double major consists of two majors. Double major: minimum 33 credits/maximum 37 credit hours each (25%�28% each major). 
M A J O R / M I N O R S P E C I A L I Z A T I O N I N A 
C O U R S E O F S T U D Y
A course of study with a major/minor specialization includes a major as well as a minor  specialization which is a combination of courses designed to provide a cohesive introduction to an area of study beyond the major. Major/Minor: 30�36% credit hours (major); 16%�19% credit hours (minor). 
S I N G L E M A J O R W I T H E M P H A S I S 
This is a course of study that has a single major with an area of emphasis which is a sub-specialization within a major field. 
Single major with emphasis: 36�42 credit hours (major) (28%�32%) + 26�32 credit hours (20%� 25%) (emphasis). 
 	 2 0 2 4 	2 0 2 5
The calculation of the number of credits into which these percentages translate in a specific course of study is based on the initial determination of the total number of credits in the course, and the application of the percentage(s) to that credit total. 
1 . I N T R O D U C T I O N 
This policy is applicable to current undergraduate students and is effective for modules taken since 2012/13 academic year in the current course of study.   
Grade Forgiveness (GF) is the opportunity for a student to redo a module in which a grade of C- or lower was received and earn a grade that will be substituted for the previous grade.  The new grade will then be computed in the student�s GPA in place of the most recently earned grade. Both grades will remain in the student�s record, but the previous grade will be designated with a �GF.� If a module has been taken more than once prior to the application for grade forgiveness, forgiveness can only be used to replace the most recent grade. 
2 .  P R O C E D U R E 
G R A D E F O R G I V E N E S S P O L I C Y	
In order for grade forgiveness to be applied, the student must first discuss the matter with his/her Academic Advisor, complete the �Application Form for Grade Forgiveness,� and then submit the form to the Programme Director within two weeks of the start of the semester or summer session in which the module is to be redone.  Application forms are available at the Student Affairs� Office. (See page 220). 
3 . C O N D I T I O N S F O R G R A D E      F O R G I V E N E S S 
Grade forgiveness is limited to a maximum of 12 credits  in an undergraduate degree, 9  credits in a diploma, 6 credits in an associate degree, and 3 credits in a certificate course of study (including transfers within UTech), and may not be used twice for the same module. If the original module is no longer offered, a  substitute or an equivalent module that is approved by the College/Faculty may be used. 
If a student fails a module for which grade forgiveness is given, the GF grade will be used to calculate the GPA, and he/she must redo the module. 
Grade forgiveness cannot be used for modules involving upper level core/specialisation, modules (i.e. 3,000 and 4,000 level), Academic  Misconduct and capstone projects.

An Independent Study (IS) may be taken as a project, a module or as a modality for the completion of a required course of study. Different institutions have different purposes for an Independent Study. In all circumstances, though, the privilege to be allowed to take a module by Independent Study (IS) will be at the discretion of the Faculty/College concerned. It is anticipated that a student who wishes to pursue a module by independent study will be self- motivated and conscientious.  
At the University of Technology, Jamaica, an Independent Study may be approved for both graduate and undergraduate students under the following conditions:  
1. Where students are desirous of pursuing projects that do not fit within the framework of the regular course offering and which are intended to be truly independent projects of a special nature relating to the students� course of study.
2. Where due to curriculum changes, a module is no longer offered as part of the course diet, and advanced level students still need to complete such a module. If the module is offered in another accredited programme in a tertiary instution, a student could be recommended to take it with that institution.  
3. Where due to unforeseen circumstances such as illness (supported by medical certificate), or other emergencies, a student was unable to complete a module which is not offered every semester. The student would, therefore, have to wait an additional semester or more to do the module. In such cases, students may request the floating of an alternative but relevant module on an Independent Study basis that will enable him/her to satisfy graduation credit requirements within the shortest time span.
4. Where only a student or a few students register for a module that would not be economically viable to the institution if delivered under normal course delivery arrangements, and may additionally cause time-tabling challenges, a request for an Independent Study may be granted.
A P P R O V A L O F T H E M O D U L E / S T O B E D E L I V E R E D B Y I N D E P E N D E N T S T U D Y 
Prior to the commencement of the module delivery, the lecturer should obtain approval as follows: 
a.	Module/s to be delivered by independent study should be first approved by the Programme Director (PD)/Programme Leader, the Head of School and the Dean in accordance with the stipulations of the Policy Guidelines for Independent Study.
A Work Plan for the module delivery should be provided to support the initial approval. The Work Plan should contain relevant module information and the activities that will achieve the learning objectives. 
The purpose of the Work Plan is to give initial indication of how the delivery of the module will be conducted in order to achieve the intended or equivalent learning outcomes/ objectives. The Plan should therefore be a brief summary of the activities which should guide initial approval for delivery. A copy of the approved module syllabus should accompany the Work Plan.  
Note: Approval to deliver a module by Independent Study should be obtained before the end of the third week of the semester in which the module will be delivered. 
b. The student/s should indicate
agreement/commitment by signing the
Learning Contract
c. The Head of School should indicate agree-
ment/commitment by signing the Learning Contract
Upon approval of the module for independent study, the Programme Director/Programme Leader should inform the Enterprise Application Unit so that any coding or other necessary actions can be taken. Where students at the Western Campus are taking the module by this modality, the Campus Coordinator should be informed. 
R E Q U I R E M E N T S 
Note that the following requirements apply to Independent Study as a module only and not  as a modality. Some modifications may be made where necessary when it is used as a modality.  
Students:  
1. A student must, under normal circumstances, select the module to be taken as Independent Study prior to the start of a new semester.
2. All Independent Study requests must be submitted to the Academic Programme Director/Programme Leader or any relevant person assigned for that purpose, for review.
3. The student must agree on a learning contract detailing the expectations and requirements for the completion of the Independent Study module, including the number of assignments and the time-line for completion, at the beginning of the semester.
4. The student is expected to meet with his/her lecturer at agreed times through-

E C H N O L O G Y	2 4 

out the semester. A student should expect to spend the same amount of time in studying for an Independent Study  module as would be spent on an in-class  module.  
Lecturers:  
1. A lecturer must be designated by the Academic Programme Director/Programme Leader in consultation with the Programme Coordinator/Head of School/Head of Department, and approved by the Vice Dean. The student must be notified when the module and designated lecturer have been approved.
2. The Independent Study lecturer and the student must at the beginning of the semester, agree on a learning contract detailing the expectations and requirements for the completion of the Independent Study module, including the number of assignments and the time-lines for completion.
The programme director/graduate studies academic director will crosscheck to see that all conditions outlined in the IS guideline have been made and the contract duly completed before recommending it for approval.  
Head of School/Department:  
The Head of School/Department on the advice of the Programme Director/Graduate Studies coordinator will approve the recommended IS documents presented by the Programme Director/Graduate Studies academic co-ordinator and submit it to the Vice Dean.  
C R E D I T L I M I T S 
While provisions are made for both graduate and undergraduate students of the University of Technology, Jamaica to engage in Independent Study supervised by a faculty member, careful consideration is made to ensure balance between Independent Study and classroom experience. As such, undergraduate students who satisfy the conditions may be allowed to register for no more than 2 modules (of no more than 6 credits) to be taken by Independent Study for their entire programme. Graduate students, on the other hand, on satisfying the conditions, may register for no more 3 modules (of no more than 9 credits) to be taken by Independent Study for the duration of the entire programme. However, exceptions may apply for graduate students who may be on the UTech�s Experience-based PhD programme, in which case, approval may be given for more than 3 modules, where necessary.  
ADVICE TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY SUPERVISOR 
An Independent Study lecturer will be asked to sign a contract. The relevant information for the preparation of the contract will be submitted through the Vice Dean of the Faculty to the Human Resources Department. The lecturer will be asked to sign and return the contract to the HR Department for processing.  
R E M U N E R A T I O N 
With the Independent Study modality there is no impact on the cost of the module to the  student as the change is only in the modality  of the delivery of the module.  
A lecturer who is supervising/directing an  Independent Study will meet with the student for one hour every other week in the 15 week semester, or seven and one half hours, rounded off to 8 hours for the semester.   
There should be a maximum number of eight contact hours per semester per undergraduate module and a minimum of three contact hours per semester per undergraduate module. 
The Learning Contract is an agreement between the Independent Study student and the lecturer designated to supervise/direct the module. Below are some guidelines for a  Learning Contract.  
Y E A R / L E V E L O F S T U D E N T S F O R I N D E P E N D E N T S T U D Y 
The opportunity to take a module by Independent Study should be given to level three and level four students. 
R E Q U I R E M E N T S F O R G R A D I N G 
1. Where the Independent Study is offered as a module, the assessment should be based on the requirements set out in the module outline approved by the Faculty Board.
E C H N O L O G Y , J 
2. The lecturer and student should discuss the guidelines before the commencement of the Independent Study engagement.
3. Ensure that clarification re the module requirements is provided, if necessary.
4. Both lecturer and student should sign a learning contract.
T I M E F R A M E 
1. The Independent Study is to be completed by the end of the semester in which it is taken.
2. The pace at which the student progresses with the Independent Study (date and time for the submission of each assignment and/or project) must be agreed by the designated lecturer and the student before the commencement of the IS.
3. If an unforeseen circumstance arises, which will affect the student�s progress, both lecturer and student must agree on the best possible course of action in order to ensure that the academic requirements of the Independent Study module are met.
4. It is very important that the Independent Study be addressed in a manner that provides students with the opportunity to pursue an area that enhances professional or personal academic development and also allows them to become actively involved in their own education which is the main focus of student-directed learning.

oth students and staff members are 
required to turn off their cellular tele-
phones, multimedia and mobile devices during classes. While students frequently keep their cellular phones in �Discreet� mode during classes, their getting up to leave the class in order to answer their phones is disruptive. Therefore, the University�s policy effective from January 2007 is that all cellular phones � whether students� or staff members� � must be turned OFF on entry to a class, and are to remain in that mode for the duration of the instructional period.

A transfer credit is one earned for a module successfully pursued at an approved tertiary institution and deemed equivalent to one in a UTech, Jamaica course of study.  No grades are issued for these credits, but the credit counts toward completion of the course of study. Transfer credits, therefore, are not calculated in the Grade Point Average (GPA), but will appear on the student�s academic record as Transfer Credit and to fulfil requirements for graduation. 
Only official transcripts from other institutions may be used to evaluate and/or award credit. To be eligible for evaluation, the grade for the module must appear on the official transcript from the institution.  New students must request that an official transcript from all previously attended institutions be mailed to the Office of the Registrar.  Eligibility for credit towards a module does not guarantee admission to that course of study. 
Modules used as basis for matriculation are not recorded as transfer credits, and they do not form part of the University�s record of the student�s academic performance. 
1 . 1	M O D U L E E Q U I V A L E N C I E S  
a. Transfer credits will be awarded based on the nature, level, content and comparability of the module to that offered by the University.
b. For the equivalent number of credits to be granted, at least 80% of the content of the module syllabus should be equivalent to that offered at the University.
c. Where there is not an exact module equiv-
alent and the module is acceptable for undergraduate credit in a specific discipline, the module may be used to fulfil University/specialization/technical elective requirements upon approval by the appropriate Faculty/College.
d. The credit transferred must be appropriate and applicable to the educational goals of the course of study.
1 . 2	T R A N S F E R C R E D I T L I M I T F O R A 
C O U R S E O F S T U D Y 
a. The maximum number of credits that may be transferred from other approved institutions is fifty percent (50%) of the number of credits required for graduation, and the remaining credits should include at least 60% of levels 3 and 4 modules.
b. The number of transfer credits may affect eligibility for certain classes of awards.  To be awarded a first class or upper second
class honours degree, transfer students must complete at least 80% or 70%, respectively, of the full course of study at UTech, Jamaica. 
c. Where a student is being transferred from one UTech, Jamaica course of study to another closely related course, limits on the number of credits may be waived at the discretion of the Programme Director. 
d. Students may only apply for transfer credits that are relevant to their course of study.
1 . 3	A C C E P T A B I L I T Y O F M O D U L E S 
a. To be eligible for credit transfer, a module must have been completed within seven years (normally based on time of exit from the relevant Course of Study) prior to the year of application for credit. This is also applicable for modules transferred within UTech, Jamaica.  Courses of study or modules that have been banked by occasional students.  A lower time-limit for eligibility may be set by the Faculty/College for modules where the state of knowledge changes rapidly.
b. A minimum grade of C (UTech� s grading system) is required for credit transfer of modules taken in undergraduate degree courses of study.  Individual Schools/ Departments have discretion to adopt a higher minimum grade where appropriate, such as in core modules.  Performance designations other than letter or percentage grades are not acceptable for transfer credit.
c. Credit will not be granted for the research component of a degree or diploma.
d. The transfer of credits is done upon admission and is a one-off exercise. No subsequent transfer of credits will be undertaken during the course of the admittee�s study.
e. Where a current student, including one from a UTech, Jamaica franchise programme, is transferring from one Course of Study to another, the C- grade may be transferred, based on the nature of the Course of Study to which the transfer is being requested.

Students who wish to appeal the outcome of a transfer credit application may request a review of the decision by applying in writing to the Registrar. When making an appeal, students must provide supporting documentation (which include syllabus, module description, examination paper, etc.) before any consideration can be made. 
1 . 5	G R A D U A T E S T U D E N T S

An exemption is (a) the award of credits for workplace or professionally certified experience 

where the learning outcomes are deemed equivalent to those prescribed in a UTech, Jamaica,  module, and/or (b) the award of credits for equivalent module successfully pursued at an approved institution, which were not considered during the initial application to the course of study.  Students will be assigned a grade of EXEM for exemption, which will not be calculated in the GPA.  
Exemption, however, needs to be based on a balance between recognising the importance of accrediting prior learning and ensuring that students granted exemption from a module can prove that they have the knowledge, skills and competencies which form the objectives of that course of study. 
2 . 1	B A S I S O F E X E M P T I O N 
a. The student may be considered for module exemption on the basis of the equivalence of formal learning experiences provided by approved institutions upon submission of documentary evidence OR for equivalent module(s) successfully pursued at an approved institution. The date on the certificate must not exceed seven years immediately preceding the year the application was made for exemption; otherwise, the student must apply for module exemption via Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) credits.
b. To be considered for module exemption via PLA, the student must challenge the module by preparing and submitting a portfolio detailing at least five years of current, relevant experience OR sitting a challenge examination, through which the
learning outcomes of a module will be assessed.  The student may also be required to attend an interview.  
c. Only modules valued at 2 credits and above are eligible for challenge via PLA.
d. The Academic Unit decides the modules with the required credit value that are eligible for challenge via PLA.
e. The student has the right to appeal the final grade assigned for a challenge examination or portfolio (see Student Handbook Regulation 4-Review of Decisions on Academic progress).
2 . 2	D O C U M E N T A T I O N O F E X E M P T E D 
M O D U L E S 
a. An exemption will be recorded on the student�s transcript as �EXEM� and will include the number of credits recognised.
b. Exempted modules will not be included in the GPA; however, the number of exemptions may affect the class of award.
2.3	C R E D I T L I M I T A N D ACC E PTA B I L I T Y 
a. Students are expected to complete at least fifty percent (50%) of the course of study as registered students of the University, including 60% of levels 3 and 4 modules, to receive a University award.
b. A student will only be allowed one (1) exemption from a Co-operative Education module in any course of study.
T 	 2 0 2 4
c. Students will not be allowed to sit challenge examinations for modules which they have failed.
d. To be considered for exemption based
solely on certification (see 2.1 a), the student must have obtained the certificate within seven years prior to the year of application for module exemption, in a UTech, Jamaica course of study or at another approved/accredited tertiary institution.
e. To be considered for exemption based on prior work/life experience which is to be demonstrated through portfolio development, the student must have acquired at least five (5) years of current, relevant experience (see 2.1 b).
2 . 4	FEES TO BE PAID FOR EXEMPTED MODULES 
      University policy applies. 
2 . 5	P R O C E D U R E 
a. For exemption based solely on certification from a recognised/accredited institution:
i. The student should submit the completed form(s) to the Faculty/College Student Affairs Office along with all supporting documentation (including module description, transcript, syllabus, and statement of achievement and level achieved) no later than two (2) weeks prior to the start of the semester in which the exemption is being sought. The appropriate Subject Leader/Programme Director/Module Coordinator will evaluate the application (for comparability of the quality/suitability of the experience/module).  For work related experience, the Programme Director must obtain the endorsement and signature from the School�s Cooperative Education Coordinator. 
ii. Upon confirmation of the exemption by the Registrar, the Faculty/College Student Affairs Office will inform the student in writing of the result of the evaluation by the end of the first week of classes.  If exemption is granted, the student is not required to complete the Add/Drop form unless he/she wishes to add other modules. However, students are expected to attend all classes (where required) and complete all assignments until the exemption is confirmed.
b. For exemption based on Prior Learning
Assessment (PLA)
i. A student seeking exemption based
on prior experience must first contact the PLA Unit for advice on the requirements, procedures, deadlines and fees associated with the process.
ii. The PLA Coordinator will complete the PLA Referral Form (see attached form), and submit to the respective Head of School Programme Director for approval of the student�s request. Once approval is granted, the student will complete the Application for Module Exemption Form in triplicate and submit to the Faculty/College
        office no later than two weeks prior to the START of the semester immediately preceding the one in which the module is normally offered. For example, if a student wishes to challenge a module which is offered in the summer semester, s/he must register no later than two weeks before the start of semester 2.   iii.	Upon confirmation of the exemption by the Registrar, the Faculty/College Student Affairs Office will inform the student
in writing of the result of the module challenge within six (6) weeks of its  completion. 
iv.	If the module challenge was unsuccessful, the student must then pursue the module normally at the usual time it is offered, that is, register for the module, attend classes, complete all coursework assignments, and sit the end-of-module final examination, if applicable.

The purpose of the Change of Grade Policy is  to ensure that the final grade assigned to a  student is fair and unprejudiced, and is based upon a marking scheme that is professionally acceptable.   
The method of assessment and grading scheme shall be submitted to all students, in writing, at the beginning of the academic period in which the module is to be delivered.  Any subsequent change in assessment procedure must be approved by the College/Faculty Curriculum Committee and communicated to the students by the middle of the semester or summer  session. 
Change of grade is normally initiated by the lecturer/module coordinator or reviewer.  Valid reasons for considering grade changes are: 
� Incorrect grade entry 
� Miscalculation of grades
� Lost script
� Omission of assessment components completed by students on time
� Late submission authorized by the College/Faculty Board of Examiners
� Failure to follow grading procedure
� Review of assessment component following grade appeal by student.
C H A N G E O F G R A D E P O L I C Y	
In order for a student to receive a grade change, a "Change of Grade" form must be completed and signed by the lecturer/module coordinator or by the reviewer. The form must then be verified by the Programme Director, and then approved by the Head of the School responsible for the module, on behalf of the College/Faculty Board of Examiners. The form is then submitted to the College/Faculty Administrator�s Office for processing on behalf of the Academic Board (Registrar) and a report submitted to the Dean in charge of academic affairs.  If a mistake has been made for a whole class or a significant portion of the class, a special group request letter may be made to the Dean and copied to the Head of School. 
G R A D E A P P E A L 
Students have the right to appeal the final grade assigned to a module.  Before appealing the final grade, the student should first discuss the matter with the lecturer, then with the Programme Director if there is no resolution with the lecturer.   
A student who is still dissatisfied with the outcome may submit a written request (using the appeal form available at the Student Affairs Office) to the Academic Board, through the Head of School in which the module was taught, within 10 working days after the validation of the final module grade.  It is incumbent on the student to submit along with the 
 2 0 2 4 �
C H A N G E O F G R A D E P O L I C Y
request any documentation/evidence which he/she believes can justify the appeal. The  following are justifications for grade appeal: �	The grade was assigned in a manner not consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the syllabus or communicated (orally or written) by the lecturer to the class. �	Evidence of procedural or other irregularities in the conduct of the examination/assessment. �	Evidence of mistakes in calculating or recording individual assessment components.
�	The grade awarded was based upon personal reason(s) unrelated to the lecturer's professional evaluation of the academic performance of the student.
The appeal form must be accompanied by a receipt as evidence that the student has paid the review fee in accordance with current University rates. The fee will only be refunded if the letter grade is raised. The review process can take up to four weeks, and the student will be informed in writing of the result by the  College/Faculty Office. 
The reviewer (external to the programme) will consider whether the grade was determined in a fair and appropriate manner, in accordance to the marking scheme and in comparison to the standard applied to other students, and report to the Head of School using the appeal form that was completed by the student.  If a change in the mark (score) or grade is to be done, the Change of Grade Form shall be accompanied with the Appeal Form. 
Before completing this form, first discuss the matter with the lecturer, and then with your Programme Director if there is no resolution.  
1. An application fee (attachment of original receipt) must accompany this form.  The fee will be refunded only if the final letter grade is raised.
2. A separate form must be submitted for each module to be reviewed.
3. The application form must be submitted to the Student Affairs Office of the Faculty that is responsible for the delivery of the module, within two weeks after the publication of the final letter grade.
4. All documentation/evidence to support the review must be submitted with this application.
5. Allow at least four weeks for a reply by the Head of School or Vice Dean.
6. Reasons for justifying why a grade should be reviewed include:
a. The grade was assigned in a manner not consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the syllabus or communicated (orally or written) by the lecturer to the class.
b. Evidence of procedural or other irregularities in the conduct of the examination.
c. Evidence of mistakes in calculating or recording individual components.
d. The module grade was based upon personal reason(s) unrelated to the lecturer�s professional evaluation of the academic performance of the student.
