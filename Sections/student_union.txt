RICK DARBY -

Welcome to the 2024/25 academic year at the University of Technology, 
Jamaica! It is with great honor that I serve as your Students’ Union 
President, representing your interests and advocating for a fulfilling 
university experience.

This year, our Students’ Union Council is guided by the theme “Re-focus, 
Re-structure, Re-energize.” As we embark on this journey together, we 
are committed to refocusing on our core mission, which is to ensure 
that student welfare, academic support, and engagement remain at the 
heart of everything we do. We recognize the evolving needs of our 
student body and will actively work to restructure our approach, 
creating stronger systems that enhance efficiency, accessibility, and

inclusivity. Above all, we seek to re-energize our campus community, fostering a vibrant and dynamic 
environment where every student feels empowered to excel.

The Students’ Union Council is here to serve Y.O.U. Whether through advocacy, student development 
programs, social initiatives, or welfare support; we are dedicated to enhancing your university experience. 
I encourage you to stay engaged, participate in campus life, and make the most of the opportunities 
available to you.

This handbook serves as a valuable resource, providing essential information to help you navigate 
university life successfully. I urge you to familiarize yourself with its contents and utilize it throughout your 
tenure.

Together, let us embrace this year with purpose, resilience, and a commitment to excellence. Let us         
Re-focus, Re-structure, and Re-energize for a brighter future.

Wishing you all a successful and rewarding academic year!
