REGULATION 5 (STATUTE XIII)

CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING STUDENT ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT

1.0 GENERAL APPLICATION  
The following conditions and procedures apply to:  
1.1 Academic misconduct and irregularities in all university module assessment, as well as other forms of academic malfeasance. These specifically relate to:  
  1.1.1 University final theory, oral, or practical examinations  
  1.1.2 College/Faculty examinations, which include all tests, assignments, oral and practical examinations related to coursework and projects at the school academic unit level  
1.2 Other forms of academic misconduct  

2.0 ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT  
Generally, academic misconduct consists of academic dishonesty, fraud, or unethical behaviour — i.e. those acts which unfairly promote or enhance one's academic standing or assist someone in the pursuit of such a result. Acts of academic dishonesty are serious matters, which subvert the integrity and credibility of the educational process. The University will, therefore, initiate action to sanction students who have engaged in acts of academic dishonesty, fraud, or unethical behaviour/conduct.  

3.0 CATEGORIES OF ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT  
The assigning and evaluating of academic exercises in the form of essays, projects, laboratory reports, presentations, tests and examinations are central to the assessment process, both as guidance to the student and as a means of maintaining appropriate standards of quality assurance for accreditation purposes. It is required that all academic assignments submitted for evaluation and course credit be the product of the student’s individual effort, except in the case of team projects arranged and approved by the instructor.  
Examination misconduct constitutes an attempt on the part of the student/candidate to undermine the University’s examination exercise, that is, any act carried out during an examination for the purpose of obtaining credit dishonestly.  
Under this policy, there are three categories of academic misconduct — gross, major and lesser offences.  

3.1 Gross Offences  

3.1.1 Offences Committed During an Assessment (Coursework and/or Examination)  
  a. Presenting oneself for another candidate for the purpose of taking a test or examination; or allowing oneself to be represented by another for the same  
  b. Surreptitiously obtaining prior knowledge of the content of an examination question paper and using same in the examination  
  c. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as gross offences by the University  

3.1.2 Offences Committed Outside an Assessment (Coursework or Examination)  
  a. Contributing to the breach or leakage of content of an examination question paper  
  b. Selling or publishing unadministered examination papers or other work assigned for purposes of academic credit  
  c. Altering assessment work after it has been evaluated  
  d. Forging, altering or falsifying any academic record, or making use of any such altered, forged, or falsified record for purposes of obtaining academic credit  
  e. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as gross offences by the University  

Gross offences committed outside of an examination shall be subject to the same disciplinary procedures as if committed in an examination room.  

3.2 Major Offences  

3.2.1 Offences Committed During an Assessment (Coursework or Examination)  
  a. Copying from another candidate’s paper  
  b. Using unauthorized examination aids (i.e. any material that could potentially aid the student in an examination for the module being assessed)  
  c. Using unauthorized electronic, communication and storage devices; using any device that is capable of accessing the internet, or linked to any other device or has storage capabilities  
  d. Knowingly allowing one’s work to be copied during an assessment  
  e. Collaborating with another candidate orally, in writing or by signal during an assessment without permission  
  f. Directly or indirectly giving assistance to another candidate during an assessment without permission  
  g. Accepting unauthorized assistance whether directly or indirectly from another individual in the sitting of an examination  
  h. Failure to submit examination script or other pertinent examination material as required (Note that a zero will be given for the material not submitted)  
  i. Leaving an examination room with items demanded to be presented or submitted by an assessor/invigilator/examiner  
  j. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as major offences by the University  

3.2.2 Offences Committed Outside an Examination  
  a. Fabricating research results, including false claims regarding research results, interviews or procedures; the omission of statements regarding interviews, procedures, or experiments, where the omission cannot be justified  
  b. Plagiarism: presenting any material, whether in written, oral or electronic form, that is attributable to, or the property of another person as one’s own work without acknowledging the source from which the material is taken. Merely changing the words in someone else’s work still constitutes plagiarism. This includes in whole or in part, but is not limited to the following materials: articles, essays, journals, diagrams, graphs, tables, computer software, GIS files, photographs, digital images, designs, models, maps, theses, dissertations, reports, projects, lectures, music or other works of art  
  c. (Some ways of avoiding plagiarism include using direct quotations, paraphrasing with acknowledgement of the source — for example, URL addresses, author, year, publisher and page where possible) This includes aiding and abetting plagiarism  
  d. Representing as one’s individual writing and/or final product a jointly written or produced submission of any description, unless the instructor has approved a co-authored submission  
  e. Submitting work for which credit has been previously obtained or is being sought in another course or programme of study in the University or elsewhere, without authorization from the College/Faculty concerned  
  f. Copying another person’s paper, lab report or other assignment  
  g. Conducting research in an unethical manner  
  h. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as major offences by the University  

3.3 Lesser Offences  
  3.3.1 Commencing to answer the paper before the start time of the examination  
  3.3.2 Non-observance of the stop time for the examination  
  3.3.3 Failure to obey/observe instructions issued by an invigilator  
  3.3.4 Possessing unauthorized electronic, communication and storage devices; possessing any device that is capable of accessing the internet, or linked to any other device or has storage capabilities  
  3.3.5 Possessing other unauthorized material — i.e. material that is not related to the module or examination  
  3.3.6 Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as lesser offences by the University
