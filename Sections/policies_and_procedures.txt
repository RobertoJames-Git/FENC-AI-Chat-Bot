POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

POLICY  
Students may add or drop modules after being registered up to the first two weeks of Semesters 1 and 2 and the first week of the Summer Session.

ADD/DROP TIMEFRAME WORK  
Students wishing to add/drop modules must do so by completing the Add/Drop Form online by the end of the second week of classes in semesters 1 and 2 and the end of the first week of classes in the summer session.  
They must comply with any faculty-specific requirements concerning attending lectures and laboratories and continue attending all classes until the Add/Drop request has been fully approved.

ADD/DROP GUIDELINES  
The Add/Drop period begins at the start of registration and continues until the second week of classes for Semester 1 (sem1) and Semester 2 (sem2) or the first week of classes for Summer.  
- Dropping a module after being enrolled will result in the dropped module being removed from your academic record.

ADD/DROP POLICY AND PROCEDURES  
- Adding a module after being enrolled will result in the cost of the module being charged to your account in the absence of a waiver from the Registrar’s Office.  
- The adding and dropping of modules after the Add/Drop period ends is not allowed.  
- You should consult your Academic Advisor before adding or dropping a module.  
- If a core module is dropped (i.e., a module that must be completed for your course of study), provisions must be made to take it in another academic period.  
- Ensure that your current timetable can accommodate the added module(s).  
- The maximum number of modules that may be dropped within a semester is three (3).  

Adding modules will result in payment of additional fees where these are in addition to modules covered in tuition fees already paid. Dropping a module may result in a refund of the tuition fee.  
Fees for modules dropped after the end of the Add/Drop period will not be reimbursed.

ACADEMIC ADVISOR  
The Academic Advisor should ensure that the student is not applying to drop a module that is needed to fulfil his/her professional goals and/or graduation requirements (and by approving the Add/Drop request).

PROGRAMME DIRECTOR  
The Programme Director should review the student's course diet and Add/Drop request, and verify the accuracy of the information before approving the application.  
Once approved, the request will be sent to the Office of Admissions and Enrollment Management for processing.  
You will receive email notification regarding the status of your request once the status has been updated.  
If you have any questions, please direct them to the Office of Admissions and Enrollment Management.

IMPLICATIONS FOR ACADEMIC RECORDS  
If a module is dropped using the stipulated Add/Drop process, it will not appear on the student's academic records.  
If he/she stops attending class without dropping or withdrawing from a module by the stipulated deadlines, a failing grade for the module will be on the transcript.  
See Regulation 3 for withdrawal from modules.

CREDIT ALLOCATION FOR MAJOR AND MINOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES OF STUDY SPECIALIZATION POLICY  
(Under Review)

The policy presents the division of the specialization credits to enable “major” and “minor” specialization descriptors in a course of study.  
Although the courses of study in the University frequently exceed the 120–130 credit hour range prescribed (because of professional requirements or international comparability), the percentage allocated to categories of modules in a course of study remains constant.

MAJOR SPECIALIZATION IN A COURSE OF STUDY  
A major specialization is the primary focus of a course of study.  
It is a cohesive combination of modules, including introductory, intermediate, and advanced modules that designate a student’s primary area of specialization.  
Single subject major: 46%–52% credit hours

DOUBLE MAJOR SPECIALIZATION IN A COURSE OF STUDY  
A double major consists of two majors.  
Double major: minimum 33 credits / maximum 37 credit hours each (25%–28% each major)

MAJOR/MINOR SPECIALIZATION IN A COURSE OF STUDY  
A course of study with a major/minor specialization includes a major as well as a minor specialization.  
The minor is a combination of courses designed to provide a cohesive introduction to an area of study beyond the major.  
Major/Minor: 30–36% credit hours (major); 16%–19% credit hours (minor)

SINGLE MAJOR WITH EMPHASIS  
This is a course of study that has a single major with an area of emphasis, which is a sub-specialization within a major field.  
Single major with emphasis: 36–42 credit hours (major) (28%–32%) + 26–32 credit hours (20%–25%) (emphasis)

The calculation of the number of credits into which these percentages translate in a specific course of study is based on the initial determination of the total number of credits in the course, and the application of the percentage(s) to that credit total.

1. INTRODUCTION  
This policy is applicable to current undergraduate students and is effective for modules taken since 2012/13 academic year in the current course of study.

Grade Forgiveness (GF) is the opportunity for a student to redo a module in which a grade of C- or lower was received and earn a grade that will be substituted for the previous grade.  
The new grade will then be computed in the student’s GPA in place of the most recently earned grade.  
Both grades will remain in the student’s record, but the previous grade will be designated with a “GF.”  
If a module has been taken more than once prior to the application for grade forgiveness, forgiveness can only be used to replace the most recent grade.

2. PROCEDURE  
GRADE FORGIVENESS POLICY  
In order for grade forgiveness to be applied, the student must first discuss the matter with his/her Academic Advisor, complete the “Application Form for Grade Forgiveness,” and then submit the form to the Programme Director within two weeks of the start of the semester or summer session in which the module is to be redone.  
Application forms are available at the Student Affairs’ Office. (See page 220)

3. CONDITIONS FOR GRADE FORGIVENESS  
Grade forgiveness is limited to a maximum of:  
- 12 credits in an undergraduate degree  
- 9 credits in a diploma  
- 6 credits in an associate degree  
- 3 credits in a certificate course of study (including transfers within UTech)  

Grade forgiveness may not be used twice for the same module.  
If the original module is no longer offered, a substitute or an equivalent module that is approved by the College/Faculty may be used.  
If a student fails a module for which grade forgiveness is given, the GF grade will be used to calculate the GPA, and he/she must redo the module.  

Grade forgiveness cannot be used for:  
- Upper level core/specialisation modules (i.e., 3,000 and 4,000 level)  
- Academic Misconduct cases  
- Capstone projects

INDEPENDENT STUDY

An Independent Study (IS) may be taken as a project, a module or as a modality for the completion of a required course of study. Different institutions have different purposes for an Independent Study. In all circumstances, though, the privilege to be allowed to take a module by Independent Study (IS) will be at the discretion of the Faculty/College concerned. It is anticipated that a student who wishes to pursue a module by independent study will be self-motivated and conscientious.

At the University of Technology, Jamaica, an Independent Study may be approved for both graduate and undergraduate students under the following conditions:
1. Where students are desirous of pursuing projects that do not fit within the framework of the regular course offering and which are intended to be truly independent projects of a special nature relating to the students’ course of study.
2. Where due to curriculum changes, a module is no longer offered as part of the course diet, and advanced level students still need to complete such a module. If the module is offered in another accredited programme in a tertiary institution, a student could be recommended to take it with that institution.
3. Where due to unforeseen circumstances such as illness (supported by medical certificate), or other emergencies, a student was unable to complete a module which is not offered every semester. The student would, therefore, have to wait an additional semester or more to do the module. In such cases, students may request the floating of an alternative but relevant module on an Independent Study basis that will enable him/her to satisfy graduation credit requirements within the shortest time span.
4. Where only a student or a few students register for a module that would not be economically viable to the institution if delivered under normal course delivery arrangements, and may additionally cause time-tabling challenges, a request for an Independent Study may be granted.

APPROVAL OF THE MODULE/S TO BE DELIVERED BY INDEPENDENT STUDY

Prior to the commencement of the module delivery, the lecturer should obtain approval as follows:
a. Module/s to be delivered by independent study should be first approved by the Programme Director (PD)/Programme Leader, the Head of School and the Dean in accordance with the stipulations of the Policy Guidelines for Independent Study.
A Work Plan for the module delivery should be provided to support the initial approval. The Work Plan should contain relevant module information and the activities that will achieve the learning objectives.
The purpose of the Work Plan is to give initial indication of how the delivery of the module will be conducted in order to achieve the intended or equivalent learning outcomes/objectives. The Plan should therefore be a brief summary of the activities which should guide initial approval for delivery. A copy of the approved module syllabus should accompany the Work Plan.
Note: Approval to deliver a module by Independent Study should be obtained before the end of the third week of the semester in which the module will be delivered.
b. The student/s should indicate agreement/commitment by signing the Learning Contract.
c. The Head of School should indicate agreement/commitment by signing the Learning Contract.

Upon approval of the module for independent study, the Programme Director/Programme Leader should inform the Enterprise Application Unit so that any coding or other necessary actions can be taken. Where students at the Western Campus are taking the module by this modality, the Campus Coordinator should be informed.

REQUIREMENTS

Note that the following requirements apply to Independent Study as a module only and not as a modality. Some modifications may be made where necessary when it is used as a modality.

Students:
1. A student must, under normal circumstances, select the module to be taken as Independent Study prior to the start of a new semester.
2. All Independent Study requests must be submitted to the Academic Programme Director/Programme Leader or any relevant person assigned for that purpose, for review.
3. The student must agree on a learning contract detailing the expectations and requirements for the completion of the Independent Study module, including the number of assignments and the time-line for completion, at the beginning of the semester.
4. The student is expected to meet with his/her lecturer at agreed times throughout the semester. A student should expect to spend the same amount of time in studying for an Independent Study module as would be spent on an in-class module.

Lecturers:
1. A lecturer must be designated by the Academic Programme Director/Programme Leader in consultation with the Programme Coordinator/Head of School/Head of Department, and approved by the Vice Dean. The student must be notified when the module and designated lecturer have been approved.
2. The Independent Study lecturer and the student must at the beginning of the semester, agree on a learning contract detailing the expectations and requirements for the completion of the Independent Study module, including the number of assignments and the time-lines for completion.
The programme director/graduate studies academic director will crosscheck to see that all conditions outlined in the IS guideline have been made and the contract duly completed before recommending it for approval.

Head of School/Department:
The Head of School/Department on the advice of the Programme Director/Graduate Studies coordinator will approve the recommended IS documents presented by the Programme Director/Graduate Studies academic coordinator and submit it to the Vice Dean.

CREDIT LIMITS

While provisions are made for both graduate and undergraduate students of the University of Technology, Jamaica to engage in Independent Study supervised by a faculty member, careful consideration is made to ensure balance between Independent Study and classroom experience. As such, undergraduate students who satisfy the conditions may be allowed to register for no more than 2 modules (of no more than 6 credits) to be taken by Independent Study for their entire programme. Graduate students, on the other hand, on satisfying the conditions, may register for no more 3 modules (of no more than 9 credits) to be taken by Independent Study for the duration of the entire programme. However, exceptions may apply for graduate students who may be on the UTech’s Experience-based PhD programme, in which case, approval may be given for more than 3 modules, where necessary.

ADVICE TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY SUPERVISOR

An Independent Study lecturer will be asked to sign a contract. The relevant information for the preparation of the contract will be submitted through the Vice Dean of the Faculty to the Human Resources Department. The lecturer will be asked to sign and return the contract to the HR Department for processing.

REMUNERATION

With the Independent Study modality there is no impact on the cost of the module to the student as the change is only in the modality of the delivery of the module.

A lecturer who is supervising/directing an Independent Study will meet with the student for one hour every other week in the 15 week semester, or seven and one half hours, rounded off to 8 hours for the semester.

There should be a maximum number of eight contact hours per semester per undergraduate module and a minimum of three contact hours per semester per undergraduate module.

The Learning Contract is an agreement between the Independent Study student and the lecturer designated to supervise/direct the module. Below are some guidelines for a Learning Contract.

YEAR / LEVEL OF STUDENTS FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY

The opportunity to take a module by Independent Study should be given to level three and level four students.

REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADING
1. Where the Independent Study is offered as a module, the assessment should be based on the requirements set out in the module outline approved by the Faculty Board.
2. The lecturer and student should discuss the guidelines before the commencement of the Independent Study engagement.
3. Ensure that clarification re the module requirements is provided, if necessary.
4. Both lecturer and student should sign a learning contract.

TIMEFRAME
1. The Independent Study is to be completed by the end of the semester in which it is taken.
2. The pace at which the student progresses with the Independent Study (date and time for the submission of each assignment and/or project) must be agreed by the designated lecturer and the student before the commencement of the IS.
3. If an unforeseen circumstance arises, which will affect the student’s progress, both lecturer and student must agree on the best possible course of action in order to ensure that the academic requirements of the Independent Study module are met.
4. It is very important that the Independent Study be addressed in a manner that provides students with the opportunity to pursue an area that enhances professional or personal academic development and also allows them to become actively involved in their own education which is the main focus of student-directed learning.


POLICIES GOVERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT  
(Under Review)

WHAT IS ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT?  
Academic advisement is a structured support system available to every student when making important academic decisions related to his/her course, available options, electives, and academic progress in general. Academic advisement is managed in each Faculty or College by the Faculty or College Academic Advisement Unit (FAAU/CAAU).

WHAT IS THE FACULTY / COLLEGE ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT UNIT (FAAU / CAAU)?  
The FAAU/CAAU serves as the hub of the advisement system in each College or Faculty and monitors the academic advisement system to assist students on academic probation to restructure their programme diets. Consultations are held with students who are referred to the FAAU/CAAU by their Academic Advisor for more intensive academic advisement.

HOW ARE ACADEMIC ADVISORS ASSIGNED?  
All students will be assigned by their College or Faculty Advisement Unit to an Academic Advisor upon registration at UTech, Ja. Your assigned Advisor will continue with you throughout your university career.

WHAT SERVICES DOES YOUR ACADEMIC ADVISOR OFFER?  
Your Academic Advisor will:  
• explain the features of Regulation 3  
• quickly establish a reliable means of communicating  
• provide individual counselling to discuss academic problems and University expectations  
• explain/interpret academic policies and their implications for your success in your course of study as well as individual modules  
• provide assistance/advice in deciding how you can meet the demands of your course and modules  
• monitor your progress regularly if you are on academic probation  
• assist you in academic problem-solving and/or interpreting the academic demands of your course and modules (including the implications and applications of Regulation 3) so that you can achieve success in your studies.

ASSIGNMENT OF ADVISEES TO AN ACADEMIC ADVISOR  
Each Academic Advisor is responsible for a group of no more than 30 advisees at any given time. This group can also serve as a support system for you during your University career. Your Advisor will follow your progress throughout your academic career at the University.

PROVISION FOR CHANGING YOUR ACADEMIC ADVISOR  
Since students are assigned to an Academic Advisor at random, the match of Advisee and Advisor may sometimes be incompatible. Therefore, should you wish to request a change of your Academic Advisor, you may complete the form provided for that purpose, and available from the College/Faculty Academic Advisement Unit (CAAU/FAAU).

POLICY GOVERNING THE USE OF CELLULAR PHONES AND MULTIMEDIA / MOBILE DEVICES IN CLASSROOMS AND THE CALVIN McKAIN LIBRARY  
(Under Review)

Both students and staff members are required to turn off their cellular telephones, multimedia and mobile devices during classes. While students frequently keep their cellular phones in “Discreet” mode during classes, their getting up to leave the class in order to answer their phones is disruptive. Therefore, the University’s policy effective from January 2007 is that all cellular phones — whether students’ or staff members’ — must be turned OFF on entry to a class, and are to remain in that mode for the duration of the instructional period.

USE OF CELLULAR TELEPHONES TO RECORD CLASSES  
Beginning in January 2007, students may NOT use cellular phones and/or multimedia/mobile devices to record classes or any part of classes without the expressed permission of the instructor. Such prohibition of recording includes lectures, class presentations, assignments, tutorial lessons and test/examination answers and/or solutions.

USE OF LAPTOP COMPUTERS IN CLASSES  
With the permission of the instructor, students may use laptop computers in classes to take notes.

USE OF LAPTOPS AND MOBILE / MULTIMEDIA DEVICES IN CLASS PRESENTATIONS  
Students may use laptop computers or other mobile/multimedia devices where they are required for projects or other presentations to a class or panel of judges.

SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICY  
Students: A student who is found in breach of this policy may be asked to remove him/herself for the remainder of the class in accordance with Ordinance 14.

Lecturers: Students should report a lecturer’s persistent interruption of classes/instruction by personal cellular telephone calls to their Head of School for action, in accordance with disciplinary measures outlined under Ordinance 15.

EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY  
The policy will not apply in the following circumstances:  
• Where students are using mobile technology to make class presentations or to connect with external sites as part of class assignments  
• Where a student or member of staff is experiencing a personal emergency that requires constant contact, his/her cellular phone/mobile device may be kept on “Discreet” mode

In the latter case, the student should inform the instructor and seek his/her permission before the beginning of the class. The instructor will notify the class of the possibility of the interruption at the beginning of the class. In the event of a call, the student/staff member will excuse him/herself, with a minimum of disruption to the class, to answer the emergency call.

RE-SIT AND RE-DO EXAMINATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
The policies and procedures outlined in this document apply to all students effective Academic Year 2025/26.  
A student who fails a module may have the opportunity to either re-sit the examination or redo the module.

2.0 PROCEDURES  

RE-DO PROCEDURES  
To redo a module means to register for the module, attend classes, complete all coursework assignments, and sit the end-of-module final examination, if applicable.  
Only currently registered students of the University are eligible to redo modules.  
Opportunities for redoing a module may be available during Semester 1, Semester 2 or the Summer Session in a given academic year. Students should confirm with the College/Faculty responsible for the module to determine when it will be offered.  
Except for extenuating circumstances (See Regulation 4), students are required to sit the final examination in the same academic session in which they registered to re-do the module.

SEMESTERISED STUDENTS  
– Enrolment and payment to redo modules must be done during the registration periods by selecting the modules online.  
– If a student fails a module that is a prerequisite for another module, he/she will be required to pass the failed module before registering for the requisite module.  
– Redo fees are non-transferable from one academic session to another but are refundable for modules dropped within the Add/Drop period (See the Add/Drop Policy and Procedures).  
– Processes related to redoing a module shall be consistent with Regulation 3, Regulation 4, and the Add/Drop Policy and Procedures.

NON-SEMESTERISED STUDENTS  
– Processes for redoing modules shall be consistent with Regulation 3 and Regulation 4.  
– Non-semesterised students must register to re-do modules by completing the Redo Registration form and submitting it to the Admissions Office.  
– Payment for redoing modules must be made during the payment periods specified under Significant Dates in the Student Handbook and other official publications.  
– Redo fees are non-transferable from one academic session. Students may request permission to withdraw from the module as per Regulation 3.

RESIT PROCEDURES  
– A student who fails a module but has passed the coursework component may re-sit the examination only.  
– The student may re-sit the exam component of the module in the next examination session.  
  The following will apply:  
  a. Students who failed an examination in Semester 1 may re-sit the exam in Semester 2 exam session.  
  b. Students who failed an examination in Semester 2 may re-sit the exam in the Summer exam session.  
  c. Students who failed an examination in the Summer session may re-sit the exam in Semester 1 exam session of the next academic year.  
  d. In extenuating circumstances where a student is not able to write a resit examination, consideration may be given for special arrangements.

– If a student registers for a re-sit examination and is absent without permission, a failing grade will be awarded.  
– Permission to defer a registered examination must be obtained in writing from the Registrar.  
– If a student fails a prerequisite module [P] with a grade 1–10% below the required pass mark, they may proceed to the next module but must still retake and pass the failed exam.  
– When a student writes a re-sit exam, the result will be used to calculate the final module grade by combining the coursework marks with the re-sit mark.  
– The original failing grade and all subsequent grades will appear on the student's transcript.  
– Only current students of the University are eligible to register to re-sit examinations.  
– Students must register and pay for re-sit examinations during the published registration period in the relevant academic session.  
– If a student fails a resit, he/she must redo the module.

SPECIAL NOTE:  
Special support arrangements may be required for clinical modules and other areas that are competency-based.




TRANSFER CREDIT AND EXEMPTION POLICY

1.0 TRANSFER CREDITS  
A transfer credit is one earned for a module successfully pursued at an approved tertiary institution and deemed equivalent to one in a UTech, Jamaica course of study. No grades are issued for these credits, but the credit counts toward completion of the course of study. Transfer credits, therefore, are not calculated in the Grade Point Average (GPA), but will appear on the student’s academic record as Transfer Credit and to fulfil requirements for graduation.  
Only official transcripts from other institutions may be used to evaluate and/or award credit. To be eligible for evaluation, the grade for the module must appear on the official transcript from the institution.  
New students must request that an official transcript from all previously attended institutions be mailed to the Office of the Registrar. Eligibility for credit towards a module does not guarantee admission to that course of study.  
Modules used as basis for matriculation are not recorded as transfer credits, and they do not form part of the University’s record of the student’s academic performance.

1.1 MODULE EQUIVALENCIES  
a. Transfer credits will be awarded based on the nature, level, content and comparability of the module to that offered by the University.  
b. For the equivalent number of credits to be granted, at least 80% of the content of the module syllabus should be equivalent to that offered at the University.  
c. Where there is not an exact module equivalent and the module is acceptable for undergraduate credit in a specific discipline, the module may be used to fulfil University/specialization/technical elective requirements upon approval by the appropriate Faculty/College.  
d. The credit transferred must be appropriate and applicable to the educational goals of the course of study.

1.2 TRANSFER CREDIT LIMIT FOR A COURSE OF STUDY  
a. The maximum number of credits that may be transferred from other approved institutions is fifty percent (50%) of the number of credits required for graduation, and the remaining credits should include at least 60% of levels 3 and 4 modules.  
b. The number of transfer credits may affect eligibility for certain classes of awards. To be awarded a first class or upper second class honours degree, transfer students must complete at least 80% or 70%, respectively, of the full course of study at UTech, Jamaica.  
c. Where a student is being transferred from one UTech, Jamaica course of study to another closely related course, limits on the number of credits may be waived at the discretion of the Programme Director.  
d. Students may only apply for transfer credits that are relevant to their course of study.

1.3 ACCEPTABILITY OF MODULES  
a. To be eligible for credit transfer, a module must have been completed within seven years (normally based on time of exit from the relevant Course of Study) prior to the year of application for credit. This is also applicable for modules transferred within UTech, Jamaica. A lower time-limit for eligibility may be set by the Faculty/College for modules where the state of knowledge changes rapidly.  
b. A minimum grade of C (UTech’s grading system) is required for credit transfer of modules taken in undergraduate degree courses of study. Individual Schools/Departments have discretion to adopt a higher minimum grade where appropriate, such as in core modules. Performance designations other than letter or percentage grades are not acceptable for transfer credit.  
c. Credit will not be granted for the research component of a degree or diploma.  
d. The transfer of credits is done upon admission and is a one-off exercise. No subsequent transfer of credits will be undertaken during the course of the admittee’s study.  
e. Where a current student, including one from a UTech, Jamaica franchise programme, is transferring from one Course of Study to another, the C- grade may be transferred, based on the nature of the Course of Study to which the transfer is being requested.

1.4 APPEAL OF TRANSFERABILITY OF MODULE EQUIVALENCIES  
Students who wish to appeal the outcome of a transfer credit application may request a review of the decision by applying in writing to the Registrar. When making an appeal, students must provide supporting documentation (which include syllabus, module description, examination paper, etc.) before any consideration can be made.

1.5 GRADUATE STUDENTS  
The University’s Policy on Transfer Credit and Exemption (Policy Reference 2010/A/08/70F) applies to graduate students, with the following exceptions:

Transfer Credit Limits  
a. The maximum number of credits that may be transferred from another institution to UTech, Jamaica is fifty percent (50%) of the number of credits required for the taught component graduate course work.

Acceptability of Modules  
a. Transferred credit must be earned for graduate work equivalent in level to the graduate course being pursued.  
b. In the case of graduate courses governed by professional bodies, account will be taken of the policies of those bodies.  
c. In keeping with the University’s grading policy for graduate courses and minimum GPA requirement, credits transferred from another institution must be for graded, graduate level modules in which the student earned a minimum grade of “B”.

1.6 PROCEDURE  
a. The applicant should:  
   (i) Complete the Application for Transfer Credit form, and enter the details of the modules for which he/she wishes to be evaluated.  
   (ii) Attach supporting documentation (detailed module outline/description, syllabus, examination papers, transcript, etc.) for each module he/she wishes to evaluate. The applicant may also be requested to attend an interview.  
   (iii) Have an official transcript from each transfer institution mailed directly to the Office of the Registrar at least four (4) weeks prior to the start of the semester in which the applicant will be enrolled. Exceptional cases that cannot meet the four-week deadline should be referred to the Registrar, through the Head of School, for consideration.  

b. The appropriate Subject Leader/Programme Director/Module Coordinator will evaluate the application two (2) weeks prior to the start of the first week of classes.  
c. The Head of School/Department then approves the form and submits it to the Assistant Registrar within four weeks of the start of the semester for directing changes to the applicant’s diet (i.e., a transfer credit to be entered in the applicant’s diet on EAS).  
d. Once the evaluation is complete, the applicant will be notified in writing by the respective Faculty/College of the result of the evaluation by the end of the first week of classes.

Students are strongly advised to apply for transfer credits as soon as they have confirmed their Offer of Acceptance. Students must continue attending classes until the transfer is granted and, where required, complete all assignments until the transfer is confirmed. All transcripts and other documents filed in support of transfer credit requests become the property of UTech, Jamaica.

2.0 EXEMPTION (GRADUATE/UNDERGRADUATE)  
An exemption is (a) the award of credits for workplace or professionally certified experience  
where the learning outcomes are deemed equivalent to those prescribed in a UTech, Jamaica module, and/or (b) the award of credits for equivalent module successfully pursued at an approved institution, which were not considered during the initial application to the course of study.  
Students will be assigned a grade of "EXEM" for exemption, which will not be calculated in the GPA.  
Exemption, however, needs to be based on a balance between recognising the importance of accrediting prior learning and ensuring that students granted exemption from a module can prove that they have the knowledge, skills and competencies which form the objectives of that course of study.  

2.1 BASIS OF EXEMPTION  
a. The student may be considered for module exemption on the basis of the equivalence of formal learning experiences provided by approved institutions upon submission of documentary evidence OR for equivalent module(s) successfully pursued at an approved institution.  
The date on the certificate must not exceed seven years immediately preceding the year the application was made for exemption; otherwise, the student must apply for module exemption via Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) credits.  
b. To be considered for module exemption via PLA, the student must challenge the module by preparing and submitting a portfolio detailing at least five years of current, relevant experience OR sitting a challenge examination, through which the learning outcomes of a module will be assessed. The student may also be required to attend an interview.  
c. Only modules valued at 2 credits and above are eligible for challenge via PLA.  
d. The Academic Unit decides the modules with the required credit value that are eligible for challenge via PLA.  
e. The student has the right to appeal the final grade assigned for a challenge examination or portfolio (see Student Handbook Regulation 4 – Review of Decisions on Academic Progress).  

2.2 DOCUMENTATION OF EXEMPTED MODULES  
a. An exemption will be recorded on the student’s transcript as "EXEM" and will include the number of credits recognised.  
b. Exempted modules will not be included in the GPA; however, the number of exemptions may affect the class of award.  

2.3 CREDIT LIMIT AND ACCEPTABILITY  
a. Students are expected to complete at least fifty percent (50%) of the course of study as registered students of the University, including 60% of levels 3 and 4 modules, to receive a University award.  
b. A student will only be allowed one (1) exemption from a Co-operative Education module in any course of study.  
c. Students will not be allowed to sit challenge examinations for modules which they have failed.  
d. To be considered for exemption based solely on certification (see 2.1 a), the student must have obtained the certificate within seven years prior to the year of application for module exemption, in a UTech, Jamaica course of study or at another approved/accredited tertiary institution.  
e. To be considered for exemption based on prior work/life experience which is to be demonstrated through portfolio development, the student must have acquired at least five (5) years of current, relevant experience (see 2.1 b).  

2.4 FEES TO BE PAID FOR EXEMPTED MODULES  
University policy applies.  

2.5 PROCEDURE  
a. For exemption based solely on certification from a recognised/accredited institution:  
   i. The student should submit the completed form(s) to the Faculty/College Student Affairs Office along with all supporting documentation (including module description, transcript, syllabus, and statement of achievement and level achieved) no later than two (2) weeks prior to the start of the semester in which the exemption is being sought.  
   The appropriate Subject Leader/Programme Director/Module Coordinator will evaluate the application (for comparability of the quality/suitability of the experience/module).  
   For work related experience, the Programme Director must obtain the endorsement and signature from the School’s Cooperative Education Coordinator.  
   ii. Upon confirmation of the exemption by the Registrar, the Faculty/College Student Affairs Office will inform the student in writing of the result of the evaluation by the end of the first week of classes.  
   If exemption is granted, the student is not required to complete the Add/Drop form unless he/she wishes to add other modules.  
   However, students are expected to attend all classes (where required) and complete all assignments until the exemption is confirmed.  

b. For exemption based on Prior Learning Assessment (PLA):  
   i. A student seeking exemption based on prior experience must first contact the PLA Unit for advice on the requirements, procedures, deadlines and fees associated with the process.  
   ii. The PLA Coordinator will complete the PLA Referral Form and submit to the respective Head of School/Programme Director for approval of the student’s request.  
   Once approval is granted, the student will complete the Application for Module Exemption Form in triplicate and submit to the Faculty/College office no later than two (2) weeks prior to the start of the semester immediately preceding the one in which the module is normally offered.  
   For example, if a student wishes to challenge a module which is offered in the summer semester, he/she must register no later than two weeks before the start of semester 2.  
   iii. Upon confirmation of the exemption by the Registrar, the Faculty/College Student Affairs Office will inform the student in writing of the result of the module challenge within six (6) weeks of its completion.  
   iv. If the module challenge was unsuccessful, the student must then pursue the module normally at the usual time it is offered — register for the module, attend classes, complete all coursework assignments, and sit the end-of-module final examination, if applicable.

CHANGE OF GRADE POLICY  
In order for a student to receive a grade change, a "Change of Grade" form must be completed and signed by the lecturer/module coordinator or by the reviewer.  
The form must then be verified by the Programme Director, and approved by the Head of the School responsible for the module, on behalf of the College/Faculty Board of Examiners.  
The form is then submitted to the College/Faculty Administrator's Office for processing on behalf of the Academic Board (Registrar), and a report submitted to the Dean in charge of academic affairs.  
If a mistake has been made for a whole class or a significant portion of the class, a special group request letter may be made to the Dean and copied to the Head of School.

GRADE APPEAL  
Students have the right to appeal the final grade assigned to a module.  
Before appealing the final grade, the student should first discuss the matter with the lecturer, then with the Programme Director if there is no resolution with the lecturer.  

A student who is still dissatisfied with the outcome may submit a written request (using the appeal form available at the Student Affairs Office) to the Academic Board, through the Head of School in which the module was taught, within 10 working days after the validation of the final module grade.  

It is incumbent on the student to submit, along with the request, any documentation/evidence which he/she believes can justify the appeal.

The following are justifications for grade appeal:  
– The grade was assigned in a manner not consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the syllabus or communicated (orally or written) by the lecturer to the class  
– Evidence of procedural or other irregularities in the conduct of the examination/assessment  
– Evidence of mistakes in calculating or recording individual assessment components  
– The grade awarded was based upon personal reason(s) unrelated to the lecturer's professional evaluation of the academic performance of the student  

The appeal form must be accompanied by a receipt as evidence that the student has paid the review fee in accordance with current University rates.  
The fee will only be refunded if the letter grade is raised.  
The review process can take up to four weeks, and the student will be informed in writing of the result by the College/Faculty Office.

The reviewer (external to the programme) will consider whether the grade was determined in a fair and appropriate manner, in accordance with the marking scheme and in comparison to the standard applied to other students, and report to the Head of School using the appeal form completed by the student.  
If a change in the mark (score) or grade is to be done, the Change of Grade Form shall be accompanied by the Appeal Form.

Before completing this form:  
– First discuss the matter with the lecturer  
– Then with your Programme Director if there is no resolution  

Instructions:  
1. An application fee (attachment of original receipt) must accompany this form. The fee will be refunded only if the final letter grade is raised.  
2. A separate form must be submitted for each module to be reviewed.  
3. The application form must be submitted to the Student Affairs Office of the Faculty responsible for the delivery of the module, within two weeks after the publication of the final letter grade.  
4. All documentation/evidence to support the review must be submitted with this application.  
5. Allow at least four weeks for a reply by the Head of School or Vice Dean.  
6. Justifications for review include:  
   a. Grade assigned was inconsistent with syllabus standards or lecturer’s communicated procedures  
   b. Procedural or other irregularities during the exam  
   c. Mistakes in calculating or recording assessment components  
   d. Grade based on personal reasons unrelated to academic evaluation
