 CARIBBEAN POISON INFORMATION
 NETWORK (CARPIN)
 The Regional Nerve Centre of the Caribbean 
Poison Information Network, a multi-sectorial 
initiative, is located in the Drug Information 
Service (DIS) in the College of Health Sciences 
on the ground floor. The initiative is the result 
of ten (10) years of collaboration among 
several stakeholders in the health and 
education sec-tors.  The network is managed 
by a committee of representatives from several 
entities, and was officially launched on Friday, 
May 13, 2005 during the inaugural Poison 
Prevention Week. 
CARPIN is actively involved in educating stu
dents within the School in poison prevention 
strategies and accessing information on poison 
prevention. The Drug Information Service Unit 
which shares office with CARPIN has been 
joined as a unit to carry out the mission of the 
School of Pharmacy.
