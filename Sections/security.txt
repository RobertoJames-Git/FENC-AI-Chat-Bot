SECURITY

To ensure the safety and security needs of students and the community, the University operates a Safety and Security Department (SSD) that is dedicated to providing security oversight and administration and is charged to deliver on these commitments.

Students are to familiarize themselves with the safety and security measures and resources as outlined below, so that maintenance of appropriate interactions, responses, and safe use of our campuses can always be obtained.

The offices of the SSD are located in the Main Administration Building of the Main Campus. It is open 24 hours every day of the year, and senior security supervisory personnel can always be contacted at this location.

From our Western Campuses, there is also a Senior Security Representative operating from our location on Dome Street, Montego Bay. This Security Agent also maintains liaison with the Administrators/Coordinators of our Satellite Campuses within the regions, through whom the relevant services can be obtained as required.

The locations served are: Barnett Clinic, UTech Academy - Ocho Rios, Browns Town Community College, Knox Community College, Montego Bay Community College, etc.

All security personnel are trained security professionals, who—if not currently serving members of the security forces—may possess special police powers or have direct liaison relationships with the local police authority.

Major Services Provided to Students by the Safety & Security Department:
• Production of Student Identification Cards
• Monitoring and overseeing performance and functions of the University Guard Force
• Monitoring and reviewing of all events and activities on the campuses
• Management of Lost and Found Desk
• Investigation of reported and observed security incidents
• Guidance and advice on safety and security issues
• Permit or deny access to university campuses or facilities
• Enforcement of applicable rules and regulations relating to the safety and security of the University
• Responding to emergencies
• Protection of personnel and property from harm, injury, or theft while on the campuses
• Promotion and maintenance of good security order on the University campuses
• Calling out of enhanced security measures
• Support to all units and stakeholders in preserving the University’s core values, and defending practices of upholding the safe, healthy, respectful, and harmonious coexistence of the shared environments of the University.

IDENTIFICATION CARDS (PROCESSING REQUIREMENT AND OBLIGATIONS TO DISPLAY)
A valid UTech, Ja. identification card is the only acceptable form of identification for students while on campus. The Safety and Security Department will produce UTech, Ja. ID cards for enrolled students. These cards are programmable and will allow access to designated areas of the campus, depending on the status of the student’s account.

Students in need of ID cards should first complete the registration process at the Admissions & Enrolment Management Office before proceeding to the Safety & Security Department. Security checks conducted on the campus require that students display their ID cards when entering the campus and present them for inspection on demand by security and other authorized personnel.

Students are expected to cooperate and understand that this measure is in support of their own safety, as it differentiates between those who belong to the University community and others with potentially unscrupulous motives.

Students not in compliance will be denied access to the University campus, library, computer laboratories, and other restricted areas.

PROCEDURES FOR LOST IDENTIFICATION CARDS
Students who have lost their ID cards will be required to pay a replacement fee of $1,000 at Accounts Receivable and present their receipt to the Admissions Office (non-resident students) or the Accommodation Unit (resident students). Both offices are responsible for issuing written authorization necessary to replace a lost ID card.

UNIVERSITY SECURITY GUARD FORCE
The safety and security functions are supported by the engagement of a private security guard force. The University ensures that its choice of security provider is drawn from the most resourceful and competent practitioners in the industry.

Students can expect to find security personnel who are professional, polite, and very helpful, stationed at various strategic points—including all entry/exits to or from the campuses, Halls of Residence, Library—as well as patrolling general surroundings such as car parks, driveways, classrooms, and other facilities.

The guards are placed to serve, assist, and support the safety and security needs of students. You are being asked to cooperate with their instructions, show them respect, and refer to them any special security needs observed or required.

SAFETY AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT IN USE
Students are to be aware that the use and monitoring of surveillance equipment, such as Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTV) and other forms of electronic security monitoring systems, may be actively in operation throughout the University’s campuses. These systems are employed to support the safety and security processes of the University and are managed by the Safety and Security Department.


DISASTER MANAGEMENT, EMERGENCY RESPONSES AND SAFETY DRILLS

All University facilities are fitted with firefighting resources such as fire extinguishers and may also include fire detection alarms or suppression systems. Some systems may operate automatically when a fire is detected, or may require the use of a pull station to activate warning alarms.

Every Department and Faculty is also served by staff acting as Safety Wardens while providing applicable support to security personnel. Students are expected to immediately evacuate any building occupied and to do so safely and orderly whenever a fire warning is raised. 

In such circumstances, all persons are required to make their way towards the nearest Assembly and Gathering Point. The Front Play Field and the Back Play Field are the designated Emergency Gathering/Assembly Points on the Main Campus. Students must familiarize themselves with evacuation routes and assembly points when using any facility on the University campuses. Safety Wardens and Security Personnel will provide necessary guidance and assistance during emergency situations.

The gate pass must be returned when exiting. Any motorist who is unable to return the issued gate pass will have to prove ownership of the vehicle to the Duty Operations Officer at the Safety and Security Department and pay a $500 fine at Accounts Receivable in the Administration Building.
