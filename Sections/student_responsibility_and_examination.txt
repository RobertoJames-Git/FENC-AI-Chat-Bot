STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES EXAMINATIONS
(ALSO SEE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT CHARTER)

As an academic community, the University seeks to establish and maintain an environment conducive to effective teaching, learning and research. This requires the co-operation of all members of the community to ensure academic and intellectual freedom and maintain the highest standards in teaching, learning, research, evaluation and personal integrity.
In addition to being bound by the policies, laws and regulations of the University, registered students are also bound by the specific regulations of the programme in which they are enrolled. They are expected, therefore, to familiarize themselves with these regulations.
The University is a public institution that provides educational opportunities to a large student body and serves a wide variety of interest groups. Thus, it is important for the institution to have a set of rules to govern the interaction of students, faculty and the wider University community. Acceptable standards of student conduct are based on common sense and common courtesy.

STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Students who breach the University or Faculty Regulations by failing to conduct themselves in an acceptable manner, by violating the rights of others, by damaging University property, or by being found guilty of breaching the Regulations in another way may be asked to discontinue their studies.

CLASS ATTENDANCE
Consistent class attendance will ensure you the best opportunity for optimum academic performance. Absence from laboratory/practical classes and/or courses where class work contributes to the final grade will have a negative impact on your student achievement. College/Faculty-specific requirements exist for some programmes.

DRESS CODE
Students are expected to follow acceptable standards of dress and proper grooming. Undergarments should not be visible. Some programmes require the wearing of specific clothing for sanitation and safety reasons and students must dress accordingly.

Examinations
In addition to regular coursework—that is, tests and assignments forming an integral part of the University's overall evaluation requirements—official examinations are held during specified times throughout the academic year.
Generally, the official examinations and their schedules are as follows:
• Final Examinations:
  - Semester 1: December
  - Semester 2: April/May
  - Summer Session: August

• Professional examinations:
  - These are normally held outside of the above periods.

EXAMINATION TIMETABLE
The examination timetable can be viewed on the University Examinations Notice Board and on e:Vision (PERSONALIZED TIMETABLE).
Publication dates are in the "Significant Dates" section of this Handbook (page 12).
Students who identify conflicts, e.g., missing examination modules and module code anomalies in their examination schedules, should report them immediately to their College/Faculty/School Examination Coordinator for resolution.
The draft timetable is subject to change and should not be used to make pre-arranged plans concerning the final examination dates.
Students are encouraged to constantly review the draft examination timetable, both on e:Vision and the University Examinations Notice Board, until the final timetable is published.


EXAMINATION CLASHES
1. The onus is on students to view the examination timetable when it becomes available.
2. All clashes should be immediately reported to the Examination Coordinator within the College/Faculty/School.
3. All clashes should be reported at least seven (7) days prior to the start of examinations.
4. In the event that the clashes are unresolved, the student will be directed to the "clash-room" by the College/Faculty/School Examination Coordinator on the day of the examinations.
5. Students will only be allowed to leave the "clash-room" if accompanied by an invigilator or any such person designated by the University. Cellular phones are not allowed in the clash-room.
6. Students will be quarantined for the period of the clash examinations.

POLICY ON "THE RESCHEDULING OF EXAMINATIONS FOR STUDENTS REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY DURING SCHEDULED EXAMINATION SESSIONS"

PURPOSE
This policy is intended for an enrolled student who wishes to apply for the rescheduling of examinations if he/she is unable to sit the scheduled final examination due to the following:
• The student will be representing the University on approved activities.
• The student will be involved in activities of statutory and national importance, e.g., jury duty, special mission, and national emergencies.
• Emergencies or other situations where rescheduling may be required will be dealt with at the College/Faculty level.

Appropriate documentation indicating the service/duty must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for approval. Prior approval from the University is required before an examination is rescheduled.

PROCEDURAL RULES

STUDENT
Advanced rescheduling of examinations will be allowed only under the procedures noted below:
• The student must complete and sign an "Examination Reschedule Form" stating each examination module to be taken and submit it to the Dean/Dean of School for approval.
• Return the form to the Director of Sport/Programme Director. This should be done at least three weeks prior to the start of the scheduled examination period as published in the Student Handbook.

• Prepare a memorandum requesting the rescheduling of the examinations, along with supporting documentation, including:
  - Name of student
  - Activity
  - Period within which the student will be away from the University
  - Modules to be rescheduled
• Submit the above to the Office of the Registrar. This should be done three weeks prior to the start of the scheduled examination period as published in the Student Handbook.

RESCHEDULING OF EXAMS UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
The University will not normally reschedule examinations under other circumstances.
Affected students are encouraged to write examinations at the next available sitting, subject to the approval of the Registrar.

Students who have missed examinations should apply to CSAAC/FSAAC which will make the appropriate decisions for students to sit the missed examination at the next available sitting with or without payment.
