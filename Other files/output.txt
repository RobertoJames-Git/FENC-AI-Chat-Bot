THE MISSION  AND  VISION OF THE UNIVERSITY

MISSION:  “To positively impact Jamaica and the wider Caribbean through high quality learning 
opportunities, research and value-added solutions to government, industry and communities”. 

VISION:  “We are the #1 University in the Caribbean for work-ready leaders, committed to trans-
forming students and society through high quality teaching, research and value-added services”.

THE EMBLEM AND ITS USE

In creating the Emblem or Arms, the University sought to reflect its values and focus while 
maintaining a link with the College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST). The compo-
nents, which are generally stylised, are interpreted below: 

The Doctor Bird (feeding on the hibiscus – a source of sustenance) and pineapples (part 
of the Jamaica Coat of Arms) symbolize the uniqueness of the institution as the foremost 
national university. The Lignum vitae, a native Jamaican flower, is abundant on the Liguanea 
Plains on which the University is located and symbolizes productivity and the capacity to 
withstand adversity. 

The sun symbolizes life, light and energy; the mountains – strength, majesty and beauty; the open book on its 
sides, which follows the contours of the mountains, the generation, accessibility and transfer of knowledge; and 
the pair of dividers, also a component of the CAST logo – technology and the continuity between CAST and UTech, 
Ja. 

The use of the Emblem is guided by the provisions of the Use of Emblem and Graphic Standards Policy which 
include the following:    

• The  emblem  should  be  used  only  on  official  university  documents.  These  include  letterheads,
faculty brochures and other university stationery. 

• The emblem should be placed at the top left-hand corner of documents or top centre of degree parchments 
and  certificates  issued  by  the  University  alone,  or  the  University  in  collaboration  with  other  academic
institutions. 

• No writing should appear above the emblem or to the left of it.

• The original colours (the University colours) should be represented exactly. 

• The emblem should not be encircled by lines or decorations. 

Permission to use the emblem must be sought from the Governance Committee through the Registrar. The process
which normally takes two weeks is managed by the University Secretariat. Forms are available on the Intranet.

The University’s motto, “Magna per artem gesta” is engraved on the emblem. This Latin phase translates to “Excel-
lence through Knowledge”. The University’s motto, “Magna per artem gesta” is engraved on the emblem. This Latin 
phase translates to “Excellence through Knowledge”.

The University of Technology, Jamaica (UTech, 

Ja.) dates its beginning from 1958, originally as 

the Jamaica Institute of Technology.  In 1959 

the name of the institution was changed to the 

College of Arts, Science and Technology and  

became incorporated in the College of Arts,  

Science and Technology (CAST) Scheme of 

1959. This was validated by an ACT of Parlia-

ment in 1964.  In 1986, the CAST Scheme was 

revised in order to make the College a degree-

granting institution, and the College became 

legally empowered to conduct affairs under a 

governing Council and Academic Board. 

The institution was formally accorded Univer-

sity status on September 1, 1995 as the Univer-

sity of Technology, Jamaica. The University of 

Technology, Jamaica Act 27-1999, which makes 

permanent provisions for the establishment of 

the University of Technology, Jamaica was 

approved by Parliament on June 8, 1999 and 

signed into law by the Governor General on 

June 19, 1999. 

The history of the institution is intimately con-

nected with the social and economic devel-

opment of Jamaica.  From just over 50 students 

and four programmes in 1958, UTech, Jamaica 

has grown to become Jamaica’s premier 

national institution with a student population 

of over 13,000.  The University  now offers 100 

programmes at the certificate, diploma and 

degree levels through its three colleges and five 

faculties. The University has further expanded 

access to its programme offerings to meet the 

demands of business and industry by establish-

ing campuses and satellite locations across  

Jamaica. In addition, several programmes are 

franchised through links with community  

colleges, and most programmes are linked to 

national and international professional  

organisations.   

Syllabuses are modeled on the English poly-

technic system, with emphasis on flexibility of 

approach, work-based, experiential learning 

and professional linkages afforded through  

co-operative work based programmes. Flexibil-

ity in the University’s academic programmes is 

reflected in the various modes of course deliv-

ery, which include the establishment of a 

semesterised mode of delivery introduced in 

academic year 1999/2000 and further adjusted 

and piloted in 2009–2010.   

The University’s mandate is reflected in its  

mission –” to positively impact Jamaica and the 

wider Caribbean through high quality learning

The University prides itself on fulfilling its 

objective as “The People’s University”, dedicated 

to facilitating access to opportunities for learn-

ing and to meeting the growth and devel-

opment needs of Jamaica. In addition to 

academic pursuits, our students have a rich and 

unique opportunity to participate in com-

munity service, sports, arts and culture which 

are deliberately blended into the curriculum to 

produce well-rounded graduates who benefit 

from a holistic UTech, Ja. learning experience. 

The institution’s academic progress, its bur-

geoning research and service initiatives,  

growing prowess in sports interwoven with the 

integration of arts and culture, signal a con-

tinued bright future for the University of Tech-

The University was established by Parliament 

with the enactment  of the University of 

Technology, Jamaica Act No. 27 of 1999.  The 

Act is divided into two sections: 

The Council is the ultimate authority on matters 
of governance. However, the nature of the 
bicameral system requires much consultation 
between Council and the Academic Board.  

The Charter  – also called the First Schedule

The documents of university governance are: 

1.

2.

The Statutes – also called the Second

Schedule

The Act outlines the objects and functions of 
the University, ministerial policy directions, 
general provisions for staff, financial provisions, 
accounts and reports. The institution operates 
under a bicameral system of governance  
comprising a governing body, the University 
Council, and the supreme academic arm, the 
Academic Board. Each body is supported by 
standing committees through which much of 
its work is expedited.  

The University is headed by the Chancellor  
who presides over the convocation and is  
supported by a Pro-Chancellor who is second in 
command.  

The President of the University is the chief aca-
demic and administrative officer of the Univer-
sity and presides over the meetings of the 
Academic Board. The President is supported by 
a Deputy President, Vice Presidents and other 
senior officers.

The Faculty of the Built Environment (FOBE) 
was established in 1998 under the new charter 
and statute of the University of Technology, 
Jamaica. However, its history goes back to 1958 
when the Diploma in Construction Technology 
was offered in the Engineering Department of 
the then recently established College of Arts, 
Science & Technology (CAST). As demand 
increased for widening training opportunities 
in Construction Engineering and related dis-
ciplines, the Faculty increased its offerings. The 
early Building Department was established in 
1978 with six divisions delivering diploma 
and/or certificate programmes. In 1988 the 
Caribbean School of Architecture was insti-
tuted. The Faculty now comprises two schools, 
namely, the Caribbean School of Architecture 
(CSA) and the School of Building and Land 
Manage¬ment (SBLM). The CSA offers one 
Bachelor’s Degree and one Master’s Degree.  
The SBLM offers seven Bachelor’s Degrees, two 
Diploma and one Associate Degree.   The 
School also offers three Master’s Degree and 
one MPhil/PhD programmes.    

In addition, faculty members are actively 

involved in research and consultancy relating to 
issues of the built environment. Programmes 
are recognized within the international arena 
by professional bodies such as UN Habitat, The 
World Bank, The Commonwealth Association of 
Architects (CAA) and Royal Institution of Char-
tered Surveyors (RICS).   

The Faculty seeks to fulfil its mandate by offer-
ing world class programmes which are tailored 
to the needs of the industry. (For programme

W H A T   I S   O R I E N T A T I O N ?  

Orientation, or as we call it here at the University 
of Technology, Jamaica the ‘Week Of Welcome’ 
(W.O.W) is what you get, a “WOW” experience! 
Usually, the 3rd week of August is busy with the 
orientation activities. It is intentional that each 
experience welcomes, informs, entertains,  
inspires and propels the new student into  
readiness for their academic success.   

All new and transfer students are required to 
participate in the week-long Orientation Pro-
gramme, which contributes to the First Year 
Experience Programme. Being new in a large 
institution such as the University of Technology, 
Jamaica, can be very daunting. The orientation 
programme captures a vibrant campus 
atmosphere that make adjustments easier and 
allows all new students to confidently face the 
challenges and opportunities of University life.

The Orientation Programme showcases the Uni-
versity’s history, traditions, available services in 
and outside of the colleges/faculties, co-curric-
ular programmes and academic requirements. 
All of this is crucial and beneficial to every stu-
dent attending the University and presents nec-

C O U N S E L L I N G   U N I T  

As we go through life, we are faced with many 

personal decisions and challenging problems.  

These can be difficult and sometimes overwhel-

ming to handle.  Many problems are solved 

through discussions with colleagues, friends, 

family, a lecturer, tutor, nurse, chaplain or coun-

sellor. In some instances, it is best to obtain 

assistance away from one’s familiar daily envi-

ronment.   

The University’s Counselling Unit is available to 

assist in addressing the needs of individuals 

who find it too challenging to adequately cope 

with life’s situations.  Getting professional help 

is about seeking viable options towards posi-

tive change and empowerment in one’s life.  

Although there is no quick fix to every situation, 

talking confidentially with a trained profes-

sional is a major step towards resolving an 

issue.

T H E   C O U N S E L L I N G   T E A M  

The Unit is staffed by a psychiatrist (part-time), 

a team of trained psychologists (psychothera-

pists), and chaplains.  They are all competently 

trained in helping clients from varying back-

grounds and cultures, with a wide range of  

personal and other issues. 

As counselling is a process that seeks to assist 

clients to focus on, and understand more 

clearly the issues that are affecting them, the 

counsellor’s role is to provide support and 

understanding, while listening and giving a 

non-judgmental response.  Our counsellors 

respect your values, choices and lifestyle, and 

want you to experience the best quality life 

while at the University of Technology, Jamaica. 

D U R A T I O N   O F   S E S S I O N S  

Typically, each counselling session lasts for fifty 

(50) minutes. However, shorter or longer ses-

sions are sometimes held – depending on the

circumstances.  While some matters might need 

only one session, others could necessitate

months of regular visits.  Additional sessions

can be arranged at the counsellors’ discretion.

All information given at the counselling session 

is held in the strictest confidence, unless the 

client gives instructions otherwise. 

Confidential sessions are held on the following

Contact with the International Students’ 

Office: The most important contact for inter-

national students is the International Students’ 

Office (ISO). The ISO is located on the first floor 

of the Student Services Building, beside the 

Medical Centre.  The ISO will assist you with all 

the necessary information for the first few days 

in Jamaica.  It is important that the ISO is kept 

abreast of your contact numbers as well as your 

place of residence in case of an emergency. 

Transportation to the UTech Campus: The Uni-

versity provides transportation from the Nor-

man Manley International Airport to the UTech, 

Ja. campus, providing that you communicate 

your travel itinerary to the ISO at least two (2) 

weeks before arrival.  Alternatively, we rec-

ommend that you take JUTA taxis only from the 

airport to the campus.  The cost from the Nor-

man Manley International Airport to the UTech, 

Ja.  campus or its immediate environs is 

approximately US$60.00.  This may be less if 

students travel in groups. 

Sponsored Students: Sponsored students must 
submit a Letter of Commitment from their 
sponsor to the ISO to show proof of sponsor-
ship. You will not be able to register as a spon-
sored student unless the International 
Students’ Coordinator has cleared you.  You 
may also email the Letter of Commitment to 
the ISO at  jsinclair@utech.edu.jm. Where 
applicable, spon-sored students should ensure 
that they have enough funds to cover settling 
in costs and liv-ing expenses for at least one 
month until their funding is received. 

On Campus Accommodation: Upon arrival, the 
Accommodations Office will assist and direct 
you to your Hall of Residence. Prospective stu-
dents desiring housing on-campus must com-
plete a “Boarding Application Form”, which can 
be accessed via our website at 
http://www.utech.edu.jm.  The application 
period for summer and year-long students is 
October 1 to January 31. For further infor-
mation on on-campus housing please visit the 
Accommodations Office’s webpage at 
http://www.utechjamaica.edu.jm/accom/. The 
Office also provides assistance with off-campus 
accommodation. 

Orientation: Students entering the University 
for the first time are required to participate in a 
week-long orientation programme. The pro-
gramme introduces students to the University’s 
history, traditions, educational programmes,

The Shelly-Ann Fraser Assessment Centre for 

Children (SAFACC) – a unit within the School of

Sciences – was launched on Monday, December 

10, 2012. The centre is located to the northern 

end of UTech, Jamaica Papine campus, adjacent 

to the Cynthia Shako Early Childhood Education 

& Daycare Centre. SAFACC was established 

against the immense global recognition of the 

need to improve the assessment and manage-

ment of children with exceptionalities. The Cen-

tre was named in tribute to Mrs. Shelly-Ann 

Fraser-Pryce who graduated from UTech, Ja. 

with the Bachelor of Science degree in Child 

and Adolescent and Development. This tribute 

serves as an acknowledgement of her passion 

and commitment to working with children and 

to memorialize her contribution to the Univer-

sity and to Jamaica. In 2012 she was appointed 

the first University Ambassador of the Univer-

sity of Technology, Jamaica in recognition of 

her demonstrated significant interest and pride 

in the University and as well as her high stan-

dards of integrity.  In November 2016, she was

The information contained herein represents a 
comprehensive policy guideline on matters 
concerning student financing for undergrad- 
uate students; to include information on fee 
pay- ment requirements as well as student 
related financial services offered by the 
University.

All undergraduate students are required to 
comply with these policy directives and adhere 
to the attending procedures; as outlined in this 
section of the Student Handbook. Please note 
that these policies and procedures are subject 
to change without notice.

F E E  ST R U CT U R E  

TH E EN R O L M E N T CO M M I T M E N T  DE P O S I T (ECD) 

All students are required to make a mandatory 
Enrolment Commitment Deposit (ECD) pay-
ment at the start of each semester; in order 
to begin module selection. The ECD is not an 
additional fee, instead it is a deposit towards 
the overall cost for each semester’s tuition and 
is non-refundable. The ECD is also non-transfer- 
rable from one academic year to the next; 
except where students are approved for Leave 

of Absence; or Deferral as a newly admitted 
student.  

Once the ECD requirement is satisfied, students 
will be given the opportunity to select modules; 
and they are required to meet the minimum 
amount for financial clearance in each semester; 
as per the approved payment plan options. 

T U I T I O N  &   A  N C I L L  A R Y  FE E S  

Tuition fees are payable at the start of each 
semester, while the following non-refundable 
ancillary fees are payable annually, usually at 
the beginning of the academic year:

1.

Students’ Union Dues

2. Health Insurance

3.

4.

5.

Student Welfare Fund

Registration

Jam Copy Tariff

6. Health/Personal Accident Insurance

7. Other fees where applicable (Law Library, 

Axis Journal, E-Books)

Students are required to pay all the fee compo-
nents outlined above. In addition, some Col-
leges/Faculties may have other prescribed fees

for particular activities. For example, Axis Jour-

Law,  and  the  E-books  fee,  applicable  to  the 
College of Health Sciences. 

Please  note  that  the  ECD  which  is  paid  in  a 
student’s  first  semester  will  go  towards  the 
mandatory  miscellaneous  fees.  Where  the 
Ancillary  Fees  are  more  than  the  ECD,  the 
student will be required to pay the difference 
at the start of the academic year.

T U I T I O N  FE E S  

1.

2.

Tuition fees are calculated on a per credit
basis, and are based on the total number of
credits taken by a student in a given
semester.

The cost per credit for each module is
determined by the Faculty/College from
which the module is being offered, based
on the associated credit value assigned to 
each module. The following guidelines are
applicable as it relates to tuition fees:

3. Under Semesterization, students are

4.

allowed to select modules and class times
online using UTech, Ja’s Students’ Portal,
via the University’s website at
www.utech.edu.jm.

Students can ascertain the cost per credit 
for each module from the respective Col-
lege/Faculty that offers the respective
modules. This information is displayed on
the student's fee breakdown and on the
Students’ Portal.

1. Based on the modules selected and the credit
assignment for each module, an invoice is
generated automatically; which details the
total amount for which the student is billed for
the modules selected; plus the miscellaneous
fees.

2. The flexibility of semesterization allows

3.

students to take a minimum of nine (9) credits
per semester; thereby giving them the
freedom to meet their financial obligations to
the University.
Irrespective of the number of modules
selected, students are required to pay in full
(100%) for all modules selected, as well as
clear any outstanding balance previously
owed to the University.

4. The number of modules selected can be as
low as 9 credits or as high as 21 credits; and
the number of modules selected should be
based on the student's ability to pay.
5. This means that the 100% fee payment

requirement will vary from student to stu- 
dent; depending on the number of mod- ules
that are selected.

6. The University may decide to offer a pay- 

7.

ment plan to students.
If offered, all students who do not pay 100% of
fees for modules selected by the Census Date,
would default to the University’s Standard
Payment Plan for that semester and would be
subjected to all terms and conditions of the
plan.

8. Students may request an estimate of fees from
Student Financing Department by sending an
email to feeestimate@utech.edu.jm
9. The Estimate of Fees is offered at no cost

1. Ancillary fees are applicable even if a stu-
dent registers for one semester of the aca-
demic year.

2.

Students, who are accepted to begin 
school in the January cohort, are required
to pay ancillary fees in their first semester
(January); as well as at the start of the next
academic year (August). Even though both
periods fall within one (1) calendar year,
they span two (2) academic years.

3. Ancillary fees are non-refundable and

9.

would only be refunded, if the University
withdraws the offer to the student or if the 
course of study to which the student has
applied has been cancelled.

6. After two (2) clear working days (Monday 
to Friday), check the ‘In-Tray’ on the Stu- 
dents' Portal for the Financial Clearance 
(FC) message.
If modules are not confirmed and the 
requisite payment made based on the 
approved payment plan, financial 
clearance will not be granted.

7.

8. When financial clearance (FC) is granted, 

follow the steps outlined within the FC 
message to complete the enrolment 
process online.
Please note that the financial clearance 
process is automated and will be granted 
electronically when full payment has been 
received, as outlined on the invoice.

The University will notify students of the Reg- 
istration Census Date for each semester. The 
Census Date is the final date for students to be 
registered on-time, in order to avoid late fee 
penalties. 
The Census Date is also important; because it is 
the final date for students to indicate to the 
University their intentions to enroll for a given 
semester. This will allow the University to 
effectively plan for the delivery of classes in 
that semester.

Any confirmed modules which remain on the 
system after the Census Date, would be consid-
ered an indication from the student that: 

•

•

•

he/she intends to be in school for that
semester;
the modules confirmed are the ones the
student will undertake;
the modules confirmed are the ones for
which the student should be held liable.

Essentially by confirming the modules as at the 
Census Date, a student has given the University 
the go-ahead to provide the required resources 
for teaching and learning for that semester. This 
means the student accepts full liability for the 
fees generated as of module selection and  
conformation.

SLB Students awaiting Final Loan Approval

SLB students are reminded as a condition of their SLB loan, they are required to pay in full the annual
Miscellaneous Fees (out-of-pocket) in order to be financially cleared; even with a fully approved loan.
The payment of the ECD will therefore go towards covering these annual ancillary fees. Where the 
ancillary fees for a specific programme exceeds the ECD of $30,000.00; students MUST also pay 
the difference, in order to be financially cleared.
SLB students are encouraged to submit all required documents to ensure that they secure a fully
approved loan by the Census Date, September 30, 2024.
No Fee Penalties will be applied to SLB students awaiting final loan approval.

Fully Sponsored / Scholarship Students

Recipients of Full Scholarship/Sponsorship are not required to pay the ECD; where their scholar-
ship/sponsorship covers the full amount for each semester. 
Scholarship/sponsorship students with prior year credit balances equal or exceeding the minimum
ECD requirement, will need to contact the Student Financial Services Unit: 
fincustomersupport@utech.ecu.jm Unit to request the transfer of funds from the previous 
academic year to the current one.

The Students’ Union Council members receive 
an incentive at the end of each academic year; 
which is paid as a percentage of tuition fees for 
that year. This incentive is referred to as the  
Performance -Based Reward (PBR). 

The PBR is paid after a performance evaluation 
process which would determine if the Council 
member is eligible for the PBR based on the 
result of the performance review. 

The PBR is paid by cheque to the individual 
Council Member and is therefore processed as 
follows: 

1. A written request for payment is sent by

the Assistant Registrar, Student Services to

the Snr. Director, Business and Asset

Administration for approval.

2.

Following receipt of approval from the Snr.

Director, the documents are then sent to

the Snr. Accountant, Payroll/Payables for

the cheque to be generated.

In the administration of the PBR, the following 
important conditions should be noted: 

1.

Based on the revised provision of the Stu-

dents Union policy approved in 2014, the

PBR is not to be “applied to Council

Members Tuition or Boarding Fees” there-

fore the following guidelines obtain:

2.

The PBR is not to be processed through the

Students Receivables Department as this

would then require the payment to be off-

set against tuition fees.

3. A written commitment outlining eligibility

for the PBR cannot be used to offset fee

payment requirements for the Enrolment 

Commitment Fee, Financial Clearance or

associated fee payment penalties/charges.

4.

Each Council Representative is paid directly

and therefore on receipt of the payment

may use the funds to settle any outstand-

ing debt to the University and or prepay for

expected fees in the future.

5. Where fees are outstanding for Student 

Council Members they will be subjected to

the usual charges and penalties as applica-

ble to the rest of the student population.

6. Where a Student Union Council Represen-

tative is a recipient of another award/grant

The Student Welfare Unit manages a small fund 
that is derived from the combined welfare con-
tributions which form part of the miscellaneous 
fees paid annually by each student. Under the

sity’s neediest students. All enrolled students 
who contribute to the Student Welfare Fund by 
the payment of their annual miscellaneous fees 
are eligible to apply for student welfare assis-
tance in the following areas:

Employment is provided for students on campus 
through the Earn and Study Programme. Stu-
dent workers are recruited and assigned to var-
ious Departments, Faculties and Colleges across 
the University and work is scheduled to avoid 
conflict with the students’ academic perform-
ance. Students employed on the programme 
gain valuable work experience as an important 
complement to their academic pursuits. They 
also have the opportunity to earn additional 
income to assist with school related expenses. 

Earn and Study operates through two pro-
grammes: (i) the Regular Programme and (ii) 
the Expanded Programme. Together, these two 
student work programmes allow for greater 
accessibility and reach to a wider cross-section 
of students who are in need of campus employ-
ment.

1. All enrolled unemployed students within a

given academic year are eligible to partici-

each year.  

2.

Students interested in participating in the

Earn and Study Programme may choose

one of the following options:

•

Option 1 – Working in semesters 1 

and 2, where students are allowed to

work 25hrs per work / 50 hours per

fortnight. Payment is made on a fort-

nightly basis.

•

Option 2 – Working in the summer 

session, where students are allowed

to work a 40-hour work. Payment is

made on a monthly basis.

3. Within any given academic year, students

who work in the semesters are not allowed

to work in the Summer Session; and vice

versa.

4.

First year students are NOT allowed to work 

in semesters 1 and 2, of their first year but

may work in the summer session of that

first year.

Final year students are NOT allowed to

work in semesters 1 and 2 of their last year;

but may work in the summer session of

that final year.

demic performance in order to maintain 

their studentship.  

7.

For the Regular Programme, students do 

not get to select where they are placed but

all efforts will be made to ensure that there

is a best fit for placements taking into

account the students’ experience, skills and

the Department’s needs.

8. However, a student is not disadvantaged 

due to lack of experience or qualification as

the aim of the Regular Programme is to

expose students to the world of work and

to provide that desired experience which

will assist them once they have completed

their studies.

9.

The application period for the Regular Earn

& Study Programme are as follows:

between 8:00 and 4:00 and so an ideal can-
didate for the Expanded Programme 
should not be carP’8Prying the full credit 
load; but should instead be enrolled on 
modules which equate to part-time 
studies. 

For the Expanded Programme, students do
not get to select where they are placed.
Placements are done based on the specific 
needs of the Department in an attempt to
achieve the right job fit with the skills and
experience that the receiving Department
needs.

Students at all programme levels are able 
to work and there are no restrictions on the
employment period for a student within
each academic year. This means that stu-
dents are allowed to work unbroken
throughout the academic year.

sity. Students can either check with the

dents’ Portal on E:Vision, or with the

has been made. 

Ques. 13:  If I am sponsored by the Students’ Loan

the number approved by the Students’ 
Loan Bureau for the academic year, can 
the unused funds from the Bureau be 
transferred from one academic year to 
the next? 

If the student has a Targeted Loan, the 
money cannot be transferred. The Stu-
dents’ Loan Bureau requires the Univer-
sity to return all unused funds at the 
end of each academic year. Therefore, 
such a student would need to make a 
formal request to the Bureau for the 
funds to be transferred to the next aca-
demic year. If approved, the Students’ 
Loan Bureau will instruct the University 
in writing. 

However, if the student has a PAYS 
Loan, s/he can request for the credit 
balance to be transferred.

number approved by the Students’ 
Loan Bureau for that academic year, will 
the Students’ Loan Bureau pay for the

the amount covered for each academic 
year for their tuition.

actual money to the University? 

No. A Letter of Commitment cannot be 
used to process a refund.  Refunds can 
only be considered after payment is 
received in full and a student’s account is 
assessed to ensure that he/she has set-
tled his/her full tuition obligation.   

Ques. 23:  If my sponsor/donor pays more than my 

Ans.: 

fees and my account is in credit but I 
have made no out-of-pocket payment, 
can I get a refund?  

No. Even if the student’s account is in 
credit but the student has NOT made an

not get a refund unless the sponsor 
instructs the University in writing to 
make the payment to the student.  

Ques. 24:  If I am sponsored or a recipient of a schol-
arship, but I paid an excess on my tuition,

Ans.: 

sorship/scholarship after being approved

dent to forego the loan, however, if the 
student wishes to keep both the loan and 
the scholarship, s/he must write to the 
Bureau and make a formal request to do 
so. 

Ques. 21: If I register with a Letter of Commitment 

Ans.:

The Students’ Loan Bureau awards ‘Grant-
In-Aid’ to students after evaluating their

they were approved for a grant. 

Ques. 20:  What if I only need the ‘Grant-In-Aid’ and 

Ans.: 

not the loan from the Students’ Loan

tuition fee to take to a financial institu-
tion for assistance, what can I do? 

The student can request a letter/state-
ment from the Student Financial Serv-

Ques. 34  Will I be allowed to register for a new 

Ans.: 

academic year with a balance outstand-

Furthermore, the University reserves 
the right to block a student’s account 
for non-payment of fees. 

Ques. 35  Will I be allowed to register with a Com-

mitment Letter from a sponsor? 

Yes. Once the letter is approved by the 
Sponsorship Unit, the student will be 
allowed to register provided the com-
mitment covers the minimum require-
ment for financial clearance; but s/he 
must ensure that the sponsor settles 
the balance on time. 

Ques. 36:  If I receive exemption for a certain 
number of modules, will there be a 
reduction in my tuition fees? 

Ans.: 

No. Students are not entitled to a 
reduction in their fees if they have 
received exemptions. 

Ques. 37:  Why do we pay an Enrolment  

Commitment Fee (ECF)? 

Ans.: 

Payment of the ECF is an indication of 
the student’s commitment to pursue 
studies for a given semester and there-
fore allows the student to begin the 
enrolment (module selection) process. 
In the first semester (only) of each aca-
demic year, the ECF represents a con-
tribution towards the ancillary charges 
of your school fee. It is mandatory and 
non-refundable.  

In two subsequent semesters it is a ini-
tial deposit on total tuition fees.

Extensions of registration may be granted
by the College/Faculty Student Academic
Affairs Committee as required and in
exceptional circumstances.

During the final  year of studentship ,
where it appears that the requirements are
unlikely to be met by the maximum date,

students MUST apply in writing, through 
their supervisor, for an extension to the 
College/Faculty Student Academic Affairs 
Committee for such extensions to be 
granted. 

The application should detail the reasons
for the extension being sought and may
include the difficulties that might have
been experienced, and why the candidate
is unable to complete in the expected time.
These difficulties should have been
referred to in the student’s progress 
reports over the period.

The student and supervisor must provide
the Committee with a realistic estimate of
the time required to complete the course.
The time period should be no longer than
one calendar year.

Extensions are not granted automatically. 

Requests for extensions must be made in
advance.

The University is a public institution that pro-

to have a set of rules to govern the interaction 
of students, faculty and the wider University

Students are expected to follow acceptable 

standards of dress and proper grooming. 

Undergarments should not be visible. Some

examination with tutorial assistance, if necess- 

ary, at no cost (See policy on “Lost  Examina-

tion Grades”). In the case of a graduate, he/she 

should be offered the lowest grade that will not 

result in a lowering of the class of award 

earned.

To ensure the safety and security needs of stu-

dents and the community, the University operates 

Major Services  Provided to Students by The 
Safety & Security Department: 

a Safety and Security Department, (SSD) that is  

dedicated to provide security oversight and 

administration and is charged  to  deliver on  these 

commitments.  Students are to familiarize them-

selves with the safety and security  measures and 

resources  as outlined below, so that maintenance 

of appropriate interactions, responses and safe  

use of our campuses can always be obtained.    

The Offices of the SSD is located on the Main 

Administration Building of the Main Campus.  It is 

opened 24  hours  every day of the year and senior 

security supervisory personnel can always be con-

tacted at this location.  From our Western Cam-

puses, as well, there is also a Senior Security 

Representative  operating from our location on 

Dome Street, Montego Bay. This  Security Agent 

also  maintains liaison with the Administrators/ 

Coordinators of our Satellite Campuses  within the  

regions, through whom the relevant  services can 

be obtained  as  required. (The locations served 

are;  Barnett Clinic, UTech Academy-Ocho Rios, 

Browns Town Community College, Knox  Com-

munity College, Montego Bay Community College 

etc.)  All security personnel are trained security 

professionals , whom if not currently serving 

members of the security forces, may possess spe-

cial police powers  or having direct liaison rela-

tionship with the local police authority.

A valid UTech, Ja. identification card is the only 
acceptable form of identification for students 
while on campus. The Safety and Security 
Department will produce UTech, Ja. ID cards for 
enrolled students. These cards are program-
mable and will allow access to designated areas 
of the campus, depending on the status of the 
students’ accounts.  

Students in need of ID cards should first com-
plete the registration process at the Admissions 
& Enrolment Management Office before pro-
ceeding to the Safety & Security Department. 

Security checks conducted on the campus 
require that students display their ID cards 
when entering the campus and present them 
for inspection on demand by security and other 
authorized personnel. Students are expected to 
cooperate and understand that this measure is 
in support of  their own safety as it differentiate 
between who belongs to the university com-
munity as against other visitors  with unscrupu-
lous motives.  Students not in compliance will 
be denied access to the University campus, 
library, computer laboratories and other 
restricted areas. 

P R O C E D U R E S   F O R   L O S T

Students who have lost their ID cards will be 
required to pay a replacement fee of $1,000 at 
Accounts Receivable and present their receipt 
to the Admissions Office (non-resident stu-

dents) or the Accommodation Unit (resident 
students).  Both offices are responsible for issu-
ing written authorization necessary to replace a 
lost ID card.

The Safety and Security functions are  supported 
by the engagement of a private security guard 
force. The University will always ensure that its 
choice of security provider is drawn from the most 
resourceful and competent practitioners in the 
industry. Students can expect to find security per-
sonnel who are professional, polite and very help-
ful, stationed at various strategic points to include 
all entry/exit to or from  the campuses, Halls of 
Residents, Library as well as patrolling of the  gen-
eral surroundings such as car parks, driveways, 
class rooms and other facilities. The guards are all 
placed to serve,  assist and support the safety and 
security needs of students. You are being asked to 
cooperate with their instructions, show them 
respect and refer to them any special security 
needs observed or required.

Students are to be aware that the use and mon-
itoring of surveillance equipment such as Close 
Circuit Televisions (CCTV) and  other  forms of 
electronic security monitoring systems may be 
actively in operations throughout the Univer-
sity’s  Campuses and are employed to support 
the safety and security processes of the Univer-
sity. The operations and use of such  systems 
are under the management of the Safety and 
Security Department.

All University facilities are fitted with firefight-
ing resources such as fire extinguishers and 
may also include Fire detection alarms or sup-
pression systems.  Some systems may operate 
automatically when a fire is detected or may 
require the use of a pull station to activate 
warning  alarms. Every Department and Fac-
ulties are also served by staff acting as safety 
wardens while  providing applicable support to 
security personnel. Students are expected to  
immediately evacuate any building occupied 
and to do so safely and orderly whenever a fire 
warning is raised.  In such circumstances , all  
persons are required to make their way towards 
the nearest Assembly and Gathering Point.  The 
Front Play Field and the Back Play Field are the 
designated Emergency Gathering/Assembly 
Points on the Main Campus and students must 
familiarize themselves with evacuation routes 
and assembly points when using any facility on 
the University Campuses.  Safety Wardens and 
Security Personnel will provide necessary  
guidance and assistance during emergency  
situations.

ownership of the vehicle to the Duty Opera-
tions’ Officer at the Safety and Security Depart-
ment and pay a $500 fine at Accounts

these hours, please contact the UTech Security 
Operations Officer on duty to make the req-
uisite payment. Gate passes should not be left 
in the vehicles but be kept on your person at all 
times. Declaration of all equipment, computers, 
other peripherals or any other personal elec-
tronic items entering the campus via the gates

On the premises of the University, the National 
Law relating to ganja is applicable and will be 
applied.  Any person found with ANY QUANTITY 
OF GANJA by the Campus Security agents, will 

“ E X C E L L E N C E   T H R O U G H   K N O W L E D G E ”

139

S E C U R I T Y

have the ganja confiscated, sealed in an envelope 
and retained as evidence in any disciplinary 
matter. In some circumstances, the campus secu-
rity agents may also make reports to the police 
concerning ganja possession and use.  If the ganja 
found exceeds two ounces, the campus security 
shall also be required to report this fact to the Uni-
versity authorities for disciplinary consideration 
(NB: the Safety and Security Department is not 
equipped to determine the weight of ganja).  It is 
lawful for ganja to be consumed on private prop-
erty; however it is unlawful to smoke/consume 
ganja in public places. The University of Technol-
ogy, Jamaica being a public place, the University 
shall be authorized to impose penalties of up to, 
and including, suspension for willful breach of the 
law concerning possession of more than two 
ounces.  In its assessment of cases concerning 
ganja use, the University will also consider 
whether treatment for drug addiction or drug 
abuse is to be recommended. In applying the 
national law relating to ganja, the University will 
always bear in mind the need to be sensitive to 
the welfare of the persons within the care of the 
University, and especially the welfare of students.  

Indiscriminate use of alcohol and illegal drugs on 
University property is considered a major offence 
of Ordinance 1999/14 of the University rules  
See page 198). 

(Excerpt from the Office of the President State-

ment on the question of Ganja, April 20, 2017)

Engagement in illicit or illegal gaming or gam-
bling  activity is prohibited on the University 
Campuses.  Students are warned against con-

ducting, participating or being involved in any  
such practices  on the University’s campuses as 
such activities  in violations to University’s Rules 
as set out in Ordinance 14 of the University 
Rules and Regulations. Students  found in  
violation will be dealt with according to the 
University’s Disciplinary procedures.  

The University is being very mindful that such 
illicit practices often result in the escalation of 
disputes that may cause extremely disruptive or

The University recognizes that despite all meas-
ures and procedures defined by the administra-
tion, oftentimes students, without applying efforts 
towards their personal care and responsibility, 
may expose themselves to some  levels of security 
vulnerabilities.  In such contexts, students are 
urged to be aware of measures that can be taken  
personally to prevent falling a victim to criminal 
actions. Some guideline and tips are: 

•

Be cautious against exploitation of fraudulent
acts , particularly when conducting financial

transactions. Use the legitimate channels and 
institutions  recommended by the University 
when paying fees, and be absolutely sure you 
are familiar with options taken.  Otherwise , if 
in any doubt seek  advice from the Offices of 
the Student Services or Student Financing 
and  keep note of any specific officer on 
whose advice you acted on. To engage other-
wise it may be interpreted that you are com-
plicit with the activity and be subjected  to 
police investigations.  
Never leave valuable items unattended or 
exposed in a motor vehicle, especially on 
seats. Such act attracts thieves. 
Always double check to ensure car doors and
windows are secured.
Be selective of places chosen to lodge, find 
out the characteristics of the community and 
determine how to navigate around. 
Use legitimate transport services if not those 
provided by the University. Get information 
from the Student Union Council on rec-
ommend options for safe  transportation. 
Plan your daily routines and avoid having

to travel with unnecessary resources or  
valuables. 
Keep family and trusting friends aware of
your whereabouts when off campuses. 
Make use of Social Media resources if you sus-
pect your safety is about to be compromised 
when off campuses. 
At social events , avoid becoming intoxicated 
and losing self control. It becomes far too 
easy to be taken advantage of when you cant 
think or act rationally. 
If involved in an accident, think clearly, be
calm and evaluate the possibilities before 
alighting from motor vehicle. 
When driving, respect the lives of others, be 
courteous to other road users and avoid 
speeding or reckless maneuvers. 

In light of all the forgoing guidelines and advice, 
students are reminded that Safety and Security 
becomes everyone’s responsibility. The University 
remains committed to satisfy all its obligations in 
such regards and urge adherence to all safety and 
security measures so that everyone may enjoy the 
benefits of an incident free environment.

The Office of the Registrar will assume respon-

sibility for procedures relating to collecting and 

recording the particulars of students nomi-

nated from each academic unit. 

After each semester exams, the Office of the 

Registrar will provide academic units with the 

names of students who have a GPA of 3.45 or 

better, in accordance with the criteria.  

The Deans will review the candidates’ academic 

records in detail and choose, at most, 10% of 

the total number of students enrolled in the 

College/Faculty.  

Academic units are expected to respond to the 

Registrar’s Office within one month, so that  

students’ transcripts can be updated. The  

transcript entry will indicate the name of the 

academic unit and the academic year for which 

the award is given.

A student will be placed on academic probation if 
his/her cumulative GPA is less than 2.0.  Students 
on academic probation must remain in the level 
last registered until a GPA of 2.0 or above is 
achieved. The maximum number of credits, 
including the failed modules, which can be 
attempted in any semester or summer session, is 
12 and 9, respectively. The period of Academic 
Probation does not extend the prescribed dura-
tion and the maximum completion time for the 
course of study. (See section 9.0 for information on 
academic probation for graduate students.) 

Students on Academic Probation are required 

to meet regularly with their assigned Academic 

Advisors to:

Discuss reasons for unsatisfactory academic 
performance; 
Review academic standing
Develop strategies, including additional sup-
port, to achieve satisfactory academic stand-

CR E D I T  MO D U L E  

A credit module is an approved University module 
for which credit towards a University degree, 
diploma or certificate may be earned. Credit is 
granted when a student achieves a passing grade 
within the University’s grading scheme for a mod-
ule approved as a credit module. Pre-university 
modules are assigned zero credit and do not con-
tribute to the determination of the class of an 
award.

number of credits.  A full-time student is one tak-
ing a number of credits that would enable the 
completion of a course of study in the prescribed 
timeframe. This would normally be 12–18 credits 
per semester.   

A part-time student is one taking less than 12 
credits per semester.  

However, where the credit load requirement for 
the course of study has not been met in the 
semesters, students may complete their credit 
requirements during the summer session, where 
the relevant modules are being offered.   

Students may also take additional credits, subject 
to academic advisement and/or special course 
requirements. 

While there is flexibility, a student is required to 
conform to the terms and conditions of the spon-
sor, for example, Students’ Loan Bureau.  

*This may differ for graduate students.

Leave of Absence is the suspension of studies with 
the approval of the University, for a minimum of 
one semester and up to a maximum of one aca-
demic year per course of study. Leave of Absence 

does not count against a student’s maximum 
completion timeframe for the particular course of 
study or class of award.  Students whose course of 
study is structured on Semesters 1 and 2 do not 
need to apply for Leave of Absence during the 
summer session. 

Leave of Absence may be granted for the follow-
ing reasons, which may include but are not limited 
to: 

•

•

•

Medical (injury/illness, pregnancy, childbirth,
traumatic experiences and natural disasters) 
Academic (internship locally or overseas, 
student exchange with other institutions)
Other (participation in approved competi-
tions, financial problems, international 
students with passport/visa issues) 

In all instances supporting documentation will be 
required. 

The request for Leave of Absence is made by sub-
mitting the College/Faculty Student Academic 
Affairs Committee (C/FSAAC) request form to the 
College/Faculty by the end of the third week of 
the semester. The C/FSAAC form is available in the 
College/Faculty Student Affairs Office.  Leave of 
Absence is not granted retroactively. 

A student on Leave of Absence is required to pay a 
studentship fee in order to maintain his/her stu-
dentship. The Office of Business and Finance will 
determine the amount. Students are not per-
mitted to pursue any studies at the University 
while on Leave of Absence.

T R A N S C R I P T / A C A D E M I C   R E C O R D  

A transcript is a student’s academic record that 
will be sent, upon request, to an approved third 
party (educational institutions, banks, companies, 
etc.) at a cost.  A student's copy of his/her aca-
demic record (called a Statement of Academic 
Record) is available for a fee.   

Withdrawal from a module is intended to assist 
students who are insufficiently prepared to com-
plete and be examined in the module.  

A student wishing to withdraw from a module 
shall discuss the matter with his/her Academic 
Advisor [Programme Director in the case of gradu-
ate students], complete the withdrawal form, and 
submit the completed form to the Programme 
Director (copied to the Head of School/Depart-
ment) for approval no less than two weeks before 
the official suspension of classes for the Semester 
or the Summer Session.  The student will be 
informed of the decision by the Programme Direc-
tor (copied to Records Office). Where withdrawal is 
granted, a “WM” will be placed on the student’s 
record, but it will not affect the calculation of the 
GPA.  

No withdrawal is permissible within the last two 
weeks before the official suspension of classes, 
and any non-attendance thereon will be sub-
jected to the Examinations Policy. “Drop-out” of 
class is not withdrawal, and such action may result 
in a “Fail” grade for the module. 

The approval of the request for withdrawal cannot 
be revoked, and there will be no right to appeal. 
Students are limited to a maximum of two module 
withdrawals in any semester or summer session. 
Students are advised to redo the module(s) at the 
next available offering. 

There is no refund of module fee when a  

student withdraws from a module.

the semester/summer session. Resumption notice 
should be given three weeks prior to the date on 
which the student is expected to resume, using 
the Readmission form. 

Any request for withdrawal will be counted in the 
maximum completion timeframe for the course of 
study. 

Any incomplete modules attempted will be anno-
tated with a “WC” .  The attempt will be noted in 
the student’s record, but will not affect the calcula-
tion of the GPA.  Students will be required to redo 
the incomplete modules after resumption.  

Withdrawal from a course of study is not per-
mitted in the last two weeks before the official 
suspension of classes. Students are prohibited 
from pursuing any study at the University while on 
Withdrawal.

to students, graduate students are required to 

maintain a cumulative Grade Point Average 

(GPA) of at least 3.0 throughout the duration of 

their course of study to be in good academic 

standing. A graduate student failing to main- 

tain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 will be 

placed on academic probation for one 

semester immediately following the semester 

in which the failure to attain at least 3.0 

occurred. If at the end of the period of

A postgraduate certificate is at the same level 
as a post-graduate diploma and generally post- 
graduate certificates are vocational in nature. 
At the University of Technology, Jamaica, this 
certificate requires successful completion of a 
minimum of 30 credits with or without out a 
limited research component. 

P O S T- GR   A D U A T E  D  I P L O M A 

A postgraduate diploma is a shorter qualifica-
tion than a master’s degree, although at the 

same academic level. At the University of Tech-

successful completion of a minimum of 30

of research). 

M A S T E R S  D  E G R E E 

This is an academic degree awarded by univer- 
sities or colleges upon completion of a course of 
study demonstrating mastery or a high-order 
overview of a specific field of study or area of 
professional practice. Master’s degrees at the 
University of Technology, Jamaica require suc- 
cessful completion of a minimum of 36 credits 
beyond the Bachelor’s degree. The credits are 
distributed among core modules (15–18 credits), 
specialization modules (12–15 credits), and a 
research project (6 credits). In some instances, 
the research project may be substituted with an 
equivalent number of credits of coursework.

The MPhil is regarded as an advanced master's

The professional or taught Doctorate degree 
differs from the PhD degree is that, with the 
former, there is a substantial taught component 
that forms an integral part of the assessment 
which contributes directly toward the final 
award. Taught doctorates such as the Doctor of 
Business Administration (DBA) or the Doctor of 
Pharmacy (PharmD) require successful comple-
tion of between 60–90 credits beyond the 
Master’s degree.

Also called the ‘PhD’ and is the highest univer-
sity degree that is conferred after a course of 
study that involves substantial original 
research. Undertaking a PhD degree involves: 
Critically investigating and evaluating an 
approved topic/problem, with the investigation 
resulting in an independent, original, and sig-
nificant contribution to knowledge; Demon-
strating an understanding of research methods 
appropriate to the chosen topic/field of study; 
Presenting and defending a substantial Disser-

tation by oral examination to the satisfaction of 
the appointed examiners; The research disserta-
tion, above all, should strive to provide high 
quality basic or applied research for the real 
world – research that can improve the quality of 
people’s lives. At the University of Technology, 
Jamaica, PhD students must satisfactorily com-

Introduction

External examiners are essential to the 
academic well-being of the University.  
Their involvement ensures that the insti-
tution’s awards are comparable in stan-
dards to awards granted and conferred 
by other institutions of higher educa-
tion.  Their comments on assessment 
procedures, the standard, content and 
development of the course form a vital 
part of the process within the University 
for the monitoring of its courses. 

The External examiners also fulfil an 
essential role in ensuring that all assess-
ments are in accordance with approved 
assessment regulations, justice is done 
to the individual student, and appropri-
ate consideration is given to individual 
students’ extenuating circumstances. 

Selection of External Examiners

The University‘s Regulation (and the reg-
ulations of external bodies, where 
appropriate) require external examiners 
to be involved with all examinations and 
other forms of assessment which con-
tribute to the students’ final awards.  
External examiners must therefore be 

5.2

External examiners are drawn from a 
wide variety of institutional/ professional 
contexts and traditions in order that 
individual courses of study have the 
benefit of wide ranging external scru-
tiny.  Normally, there must not be: 

5.2.1 reciprocal external examining between 

courses in two institutions; 

5.2.2 replacement of an external examiner by 
an individual from the same institution; 

5.2.3 an external examiner from an institution 
which has been the source of examiners 
in the recent past (normally four years).  

5.3 When making the nomination of an 
external examiner, the Head of 
School/Department (or equivalent), in 
consultation with other Heads of 
School/Department (if appropriate) will 
ensure that: 

5.3.1 Where there is a team of external 

examiners for a course of study, there is 
an adequate balance including: 

(a) examining experience,

(b) academic and professional prac-

titioners, and

(c) members from different institutions

of higher education

5.3.2 The nominee has achieved academic 
and professional qualifications in an 

“ E X C E L L E N C E   T H R O U G H   K N O W L E D G E ”

177

R E G U L A T I O N   4

appropriate subject, and at a level 
appropriate for the course of study to be 
examined. 

approved by another validating 

body; 

In addition, the nominee must not be: 

5.3.3 The nominee is of an appropriate aca-
demic and/or professional standing to 
maintain the comparability of academic 
standards in the context of higher  
education. 

5.3.4 The nominee has sufficient recent 

experience of examining at the required 
level, preferably including experience as 
an external examiner or comparable 
related experience to indicate compe-
tence in assessing students in the sub-
ject area concerned. 

5.3.5 The nominee will not have such other 

extensive examining commitments that 
they cannot properly discharge their 
duties in respect of this University. 

5.3.6 The nominee will be impartial in judge-

ment, and for the last five years the 
nominee normally must not have been: 

(a) a member of staff, a student or a

(d) personally associated with the

sponsorship of students;

(e)

required to assess colleagues who

are recruited as students to the

course of study;

(f )

in a position to influence signifi-

cantly the future employment of 

students on the Course of Study; 

(g)

likely to be involved with student

placements or training in the 

examiner’s organisation.

5.3.7 An external examiner must immediately 
notify the University Registrar in writing 
of any material change of circumstances 
which would lead to a breach of the  
conditions of appointment outlined 
above.

with this University.

External examiners shall be appointed
by the Academic Board after considera-
tion of recommendations from the
Faculty/College Board. The University
Registrar will forward a letter of appoint-

be extended for a period of not more 
than two years for a new course of study 
in order to provide continuity between 
successive groups of external examiners. 
External examiners who have served for 
one appointment period in the same 
course of study should not be consid-
ered for re-nomination in the same 
course until at least four years have 
elapsed. 

Regulations for the award(s), Notes of
Guidance, and information on fees and
expenses will be forwarded at this stage
to the external examiner by the Univer-
sity Registrar.  In order to ensure that the 
new external examiner is fully aware of
all matters which have been raised pre-
viously, he/she will also be provided
with the annual reports of her/his prede-
cessor for the previous two years.

The Head of School/Department shall
ensure that the external examiner:

receives a copy of a definitive document, 
together with any other information 
relating to the academic nature of the 
Course of Study to be considered; 

is adequately briefed on the procedures 
and timetable for the assessment of stu-

sity.  Validation is a process wherein
external examiners scrutinize samples of
students’ assessed work and grades to
ensure that appropriate quality and
standards are maintained within the
specifications of the relevant course of
study.  The duties of external examiners
shall include:

consultation with members of the

of examination papers and other forms 
of assessment; 

consideration of the standard of mark-
ing of papers and other forms of assess-
ment and reporting to members of the

those acts which have the effect of unfairly promoting or enhancing one’s academic standing or 

assisting someone in the pursuit of such a result. Acts of academic dishonesty are serious matters, 

which subvert the integrity and credibility of the educational process. The University will, therefore, 

initiate action to sanction students who have engaged in acts of academic dishonesty, fraud or 

unethical behaviour/conduct.

The assigning and evaluating of academic exercises in the form of essays, projects, laboratory 

reports, presentations, tests and examinations are central to the assessment process, both as guid-

ance to the student and as a means of maintaining appropriate standards of quality assurance for

accreditation purposes. It is required that all academic assignments submitted for evaluation and 

course credit be the product of the student’s individual effort, except in the case of team projects 

arranged and approved of by the instructor. 

Examination misconduct constitutes an attempt on the part of the student/candidate to undermine 
the University’s examination exercise, that is, any act carried out during an examination for the  
purpose of obtaining credit dishonestly.  

Under this policy, there are three categories of academic misconduct – gross, major and lesser 
offences. 

3.1

Gross Offences 

3.1.1  Offences committed during an assessment (course work and/or 

examination) 

a. Presenting oneself for another candidate for the purpose of taking a test or

examination; or by allowing oneself to be represented by another for the same;

b. Surreptitiously obtaining prior knowledge of the content of an examination

question paper and using same in the examination.. 

c. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the

integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as gross 

offences by the University.

3.1.2  Offences Committed Outside an Assessment (Coursework or Examination) 

a. Contributing to the breach or leakage of content of an examination question

paper.

b. Selling, publishing unadministered examination papers or other work assigned 

for purposes of academic credit;

c.Altering assessment work after it has been evaluated; 

d. Forging, altering or falsifying any academic record, or making use of any such

e. Other offences not herein specified but which subvert or would subvert the

integrity and credibility of the assessment process and deemed as gross 

offences by the University.

Gross offences committed outside of an examination shall be subject to the same 

disciplinary procedures as if committed in an examination room.

Dropping a module after being enrolled
will result in the dropped module being
removed from your academic record.

Adding a module after being enrolled will

result in the cost of the module being

a waiver from the Registrar’s Office. 

The adding and dopping of modules after
the Add/Drop period ends is not allowed.

You should consult your Academic Advisor
before adding or dropping a module.

If a core module is dropped i.e. a module
that must be completed for your course of
study, provisions must be made to take it
in another academic period.
Ensure that your current timetable can
accommodate the added module(s).

The maximum number of modules that
may be dropped within a semester is
three (3).

This policy is applicable to current undergradu-

ate students and is effective for modules taken 

since 2012/13 academic year in the current 

course of study.   

Grade Forgiveness (GF) is the opportunity for a 

student to redo a module in which a grade of C- 

or lower was received and earn a grade that will 

be substituted for the previous grade.  The new 

grade will then be computed in the student’s 

GPA in place of the most recently earned grade. 

Both grades will remain in the student’s record, 

but the previous grade will be designated with 

a “GF.” If a module has been taken more than 

once prior to the application for grade forgive-

ness, forgiveness can only be used to replace 

the most recent grade.

him/herself, with a minimum of disruption to 

the class, to answer the emergency call.

3. Only currently registered students of the

University are eligible to redo modules.

4. Opportunities for redoing a module may

be available during Semester 1, Semester 2
or the Summer Session in a given academic
year.  Students should confirm with the
College/Faculty that is responsible for the
module to determine when it will be
offered.

5.

Except for extenuating circumstances (See
Regulation 4), students are required to sit

M O D U L E   E Q U I V A L E N C I E S    

A transfer credit is one earned for a module suc-

cessfully pursued at an approved tertiary insti-

tution and deemed equivalent to one in a 

UTech, Jamaica course of study.  No grades are 

issued for these credits, but the credit counts 

toward completion of the course of study. 

Transfer credits, therefore, are not calculated in 

the Grade Point Average (GPA), but will appear 

on the student’s academic record as Transfer 

Credit and to fulfil requirements for graduation. 

Only official transcripts from other institutions 

may be used to evaluate and/or award credit. 

To be eligible for evaluation, the grade for the 

module must appear on the official transcript 

from the institution.  New students must 

request that an official transcript from all pre-

viously attended institutions be mailed to the 

Office of the Registrar.  Eligibility for credit 

towards a module does not guarantee admis-

sion to that course of study. 

Modules used as basis for matriculation are not 

recorded as transfer credits, and they do not 

form part of the University’s record of the stu-

dent’s academic performance. 

a.

b.

Transfer credits will be awarded based on
the nature, level, content and comparabil-
ity of the module to that offered by the
University.

For the equivalent number of credits to be
granted, at least 80% of the content of the
module syllabus should be equivalent to
that offered at the University.

c. Where there is not an exact module equiv-
alent and the module is acceptable for
undergraduate credit in a specific dis-
cipline, the module may be used to fulfil
University/specialization/technical elective
requirements upon approval by the appro-
priate Faculty/College.

d.

The credit transferred must be appropriate
and applicable to the educational goals of
the course of study.

The maximum number of credits that may
be transferred from other approved institu-
tions is fifty percent (50%) of the number
of credits required for graduation, and the
remaining credits should include at least
60% of levels 3 and 4 modules.

must complete at least 80% or 70%, 
respectively, of the full course of study at 
UTech, Jamaica. 

c. Where a student is being transferred from
one UTech, Jamaica course of study to
another closely related course, limits on
the number of credits may be waived at
the discretion of the Programme Director. 

d.

Students may only apply for transfer 
credits that are relevant to their course of
study.

A C C E P T A B I L I T Y   O F   M O D U L E S  

a.

To be eligible for credit transfer, a module
must have been completed within seven
years (normally based on time of exit from
the relevant Course of Study) prior to the
year of application for credit. This is also
applicable for modules transferred within
UTech, Jamaica.  Courses of study or mod-
ules that have been banked by occasional
students.  A lower time-limit for eligibility
may be set by the Faculty/College for mod-
ules where the state of knowledge
changes rapidly.

b. A minimum grade of C (UTech’ s grading
system) is required for credit transfer of 
modules taken in undergraduate degree
courses of study.  Individual Schools/
Departments have discretion to adopt a
higher minimum grade where appropriate,
such as in core modules.  Performance des-
ignations other than letter or percentage
grades are not acceptable for transfer
credit.

c.

d.

Credit will not be granted for the research
component of a degree or diploma.

The transfer of credits is done upon admis-
sion and is a one-off exercise. No subse-
quent transfer of credits will be undertaken
during the course of the admittee’s study.

e. Where a current student, including one 
from a UTech, Jamaica franchise pro-
gramme, is transferring from one Course of
Study to another, the C- grade may be
transferred, based on the nature of the 
Course of Study to which the transfer is
being requested.

Students who wish to appeal the outcome of a 
transfer credit application may request a review 
of the decision by applying in writing to the 
Registrar. When making an appeal, students 
must provide supporting documentation 
(which include syllabus, module description, 
examination paper, etc.) before any considera-

The applicant should:

(i) Complete the Application for Transfer

Credit form, and enter the details of

the modules for which he/she wishes

to be evaluated. 

(ii) Attach supporting documentation

(detailed module outline/description,

syllabus, examination papers, tran-

transfer institution mailed directly to 

the Office of the Registrar at least four

(4) weeks prior to the start of the

semester in which the Applicant will

be enrolled. Exceptional cases that 

cannot meet the four-week deadline 

should be referred to the Registrar, 

through the Head of School, for  

consideration. 

b.

c.

The appropriate Subject Leader/Pro-
gramme Director/Module Coordinator will
evaluate the  application two (2) weeks
prior to the start of the first week of classes.

The Head of School/Department then
approves the form and submit it to the
Assistant Registrar within four weeks of the
start of the semester for directing changes
to the  applicant’s diet, i.e, a transfer credit
to be entered in the applicants diet on EAS.

d. Once the evaluation is complete the

Applicant will be notified in writing by the
respective Faculty/College of the result of
the evaluation by the end of the first week
of classes.

Students are strongly advised to apply for trans-

fer credits as soon as they have confirmed their 

Offer of Acceptance.  Students must continue 

attending classes until the transfer is granted 

and, where required, complete all assignments 

until the transfer is confirmed.  All transcripts 

and other documents filed in support of trans-

fer credit request become the property of

equivalent to those prescribed in a UTech,

credits for equivalent module successfully pur-
sued at an approved institution, which were not 
considered during the initial application to the 
course of study.  Students will be assigned a 
grade of EXEM for exemption, which will not be 
calculated in the GPA.  

Exemption, however, needs to be based on a 
balance between recognising the importance 
of accrediting prior learning and ensuring that 
students granted exemption from a module 
can prove that they have the knowledge, skills 
and competencies which form the objectives of 
that course of study.

The student may be considered for module
exemption on the basis of the equivalence
of formal learning experiences provided by
approved institutions upon submission of
documentary evidence OR for equivalent 
module(s) successfully pursued at an
approved institution. The date on the cer-
tificate must not exceed seven years imme-
diately preceding the year the application
was made for exemption; otherwise, the
student must apply for module exemption
via Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) credits.

To be considered for module exemption
via PLA, the student must challenge the
module by preparing and submitting a
portfolio detailing at least five years of cur-
rent, relevant experience OR sitting a chal-
lenge examination, through which the

learning outcomes of a module will be 
assessed.  The student may also be 
required to attend an interview.

The purpose of the Change of Grade Policy is  
to ensure that the final grade assigned to a  
student is fair and unprejudiced, and is based 
upon a marking scheme that is professionally 
acceptable.   

The method of assessment and grading scheme 
shall be submitted to all students, in writing, at 
the beginning of the academic period in which 
the module is to be delivered.  Any subsequent 
change in assessment procedure must be 
approved by the College/Faculty Curriculum 
Committee and communicated to the students 
by the middle of the semester or summer  
session. 

Change of grade is normally initiated by the 
lecturer/module coordinator or reviewer.  Valid 
reasons for considering grade changes are: 
•
Incorrect grade entry 
• Miscalculation of grades
•
•

Lost script
Omission of assessment components
completed by students on time
Late submission authorized by the
College/Faculty Board of Examiners
Failure to follow grading procedure

Review of assessment component follow-
ing grade appeal by student.

•

•
•

In order for a student to receive a grade change, 

a "Change of Grade" form must be completed 
and signed by the lecturer/module coordinator 
or by the reviewer. The form must then be veri-
fied by the Programme Director, and then 
approved by the Head of the School respon-
sible for the module, on behalf of the 
College/Faculty Board of Examiners. The form is 
then submitted to the College/Faculty Admin-
istrator’s Office for processing on behalf of the 
Academic Board (Registrar) and a report sub-
mitted to the Dean in charge of academic 
affairs.  If a mistake has been made for a whole 
class or a significant portion of the class, a spe-
cial group request letter may be made to the 
Dean and copied to the Head of School. 

G R A D E   A P P E A L  

Students have the right to appeal the final 
grade assigned to a module.  Before appealing 
the final grade, the student should first discuss 
the matter with the lecturer, then with the Pro-
gramme Director if there is no resolution with 
the lecturer.   

A student who is still dissatisfied with the out-
come may submit a written request (using the 
appeal form available at the Student Affairs 
Office) to the Academic Board, through the 
Head of School in which the module was 
taught, within 10 working days after the val-
idation of the final module grade.  It is incum-
bent on the student to submit along with the

request any documentation/evidence which 
he/she believes can justify the appeal. The  
following are justifications for grade appeal: 
•

The grade was assigned in a manner not
consistent with the standards and proce-
dures specified in the syllabus or com-
municated (orally or written) by the
lecturer to the class.

•

•

•

Evidence of procedural or other
irregularities in the conduct of the
examination/assessment.

Evidence of mistakes in calculating or
recording individual assessment compo-
nents.

The grade awarded was based upon per-
sonal reason(s) unrelated to the lecturer's
professional evaluation of the academic 
performance of the student.

The appeal form must be accompanied by a 
receipt as evidence that the student has paid 
the review fee in accordance with current Uni-
versity rates. The fee will only be refunded if the 
letter grade is raised. The review process can 
take up to four weeks, and the student will be 
informed in writing of the result by the  
College/Faculty Office. 

The reviewer (external to the programme) will 
consider whether the grade was determined in 
a fair and appropriate manner, in accordance to 
the marking scheme and in comparison to the 
standard applied to other students, and report 
to the Head of School using the appeal form 
that was completed by the student.  If a change 
in the mark (score) or grade is to be done, the 
Change of Grade Form shall be accompanied 
with the Appeal Form. 

Before completing this form, first discuss the 
matter with the lecturer, and then with your 
Programme Director if there is no resolution.  

1. An application fee (attachment of original

receipt) must accompany this form.  The
fee will be refunded only if the final letter
grade is raised.

2. A separate form must be submitted for

each module to be reviewed.

3.

The application form must be submitted to
the Student Affairs Office of the Faculty
that is responsible for the delivery of the
module, within two weeks after the pub-
lication of the final letter grade.

4. All documentation/evidence to support
the review must be submitted with this
application.

5. Allow at least four weeks for a reply by the

Head of School or Vice Dean.

6.

Reasons for justifying why a grade should
be reviewed include:

a.

b.

c.

d.

The grade was assigned in a manner
not consistent with the standards and
procedures specified in the syllabus
or communicated (orally or written)
by the lecturer to the class.

Evidence of procedural or other irreg-
ularities in the conduct of the
examination.

Evidence of mistakes in calculating or
recording individual components.

The module grade was based upon 
personal reason(s) unrelated to the
lecturer’s professional evaluation of 
the academic performance of the
student.

Building a Future Together

With arts, science and technology 

Let’s build a future together 

A future that is like a ship 

Sailing bravely through any weather 

So as we seek to enrich our lives 

And new horizons explore 

UTech stands to point the way 

To make our future secure 

Chorus 

University of Technology, Jamaica 

We will always sing in praise of you 

And the knowledge you give 

Teaches us how to live 

So to UTech we’ll always be true 

You teach us to give of our best 

To lend a hand, to inspire 

To answer where‘er duty calls 

And to aim yet higher and higher 

Wherever our lives shall lead us 

Your banner will be unfurled 

As we proudly stand to serve 

Our nation and the wide world.
