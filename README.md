# 🎓 UTech (FENC) Chatbot  

The **UTech FAQ Chatbot** is a web-based AI assistant designed to answer frequently asked questions from the University of Technology, Jamaica (UTech) student handbook.  
It provides quick and accurate responses by reading only the **relevant sections** of the handbook, ensuring reliability while reducing confusion.

## 📌 Overview   

Navigating university policies can be overwhelming for students. This chatbot was developed to:  
- Provide **instant answers** to common student queries.  
- Ensure responses are **accurate and aligned** with the official student handbook.  
- Support staff by **reducing repetitive inquiries**.  
The chatbot uses a **keyword-based section matching** system to select relevant handbook content, which is then processed by an AI model (currently Gemini via API).
